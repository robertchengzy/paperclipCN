# Rich ACP integration and qualification report

## Current integration — 2026-10-08

The experimental Runner admits **Pi profile 22** (`sha256:e92078bee3c23bec4100aa589013a44613d054cd686826534025d8019e9f39a9`) and
**Cursor profile 15**. Copilot remains pending at **profile 17**. Legacy
`pi_local` is unchanged. Pi accepts any explicit caller-selected provider/model
ID and requires native acknowledgement; qualification models are examples, not
an allowlist or a fallback.

The requested task execution and human-control paths have seven passing cloud
cases on profile 19 with the accepted Sonnet 4.6/low fixture. Profile 22 retains
that wrapper, helper and extension, incorporates master's environment changes,
patches brace-expansion to the official 5.0.12 payload, and excludes general AWS
IAM credentials from Pi's environment. Bedrock's provider-scoped bearer key is
supported. Those paid results retain their original profile-19 identity;
current integration is verified separately by source, package and CI checks.
Accounting and the wider platform/provider matrix remain deferred. See the
[readiness plan](../plans/2026-10-02-pi-production-readiness.md#current-delivery-scope--2026-10-08)
for the exact source/image evidence and merge status.

All dated checkpoints below describe historical qualification attempts. Their
failures and profile numbers are retained; they are not current release gates.

## Historical Pi 1.0 qualification checkpoint — October 2, 2026

Pi uses `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@1.0.0`, `pi-acp@0.0.33`, and ACPX
`0.13.1`. Profile **13** adds explicit, native-acknowledged reasoning selection
for the exact model `openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731`. New Pi
configuration and qualification cases select `low`. This candidate is not yet
production qualified. Cursor v10 and Copilot v13 remain gated.

The installed profile-13 candidate at `eac50643213d0902a93a5384bae2f1d6c065c9f2`
has paid local passes for hello, semantic question continuation, all four native
question forms, and human permission denial without a file side effect. Its
paid extended Runner `get-task-context` case passes against the authenticated
seeded test control plane. That protocol case does not qualify the Product UI.
File validation, pending-input controller restart, and three-turn warm
continuation remain failed and unregraded. Assertion repairs and an actual
SDK/wrapper replay now cover the identified boundaries; fresh live proof is
still required. See the [historical Pi checkpoint](runner-pi-capabilities.md#historical-profile-13-qualification-checkpoint-2026-10-02)
for the request-stream diagnosis and remaining platform gates.

Copilot's declaration hashes the shared sidecar, sidecar protocol, direct driver,
and generated schema bundle. Pi's reasoning field changed those four files, so
Copilot's pending declaration advances to v13 with digest
`sha256:3ff08fbe76fe4549c9eb01e8794428d8909c65c151d775220f2ec111d9e6f7c1`.
Its executable, distribution closure, model, permissions, and qualification
status are unchanged. The v12 declaration remains historical, and v12 warm
sessions are rejected. This source-identity repair supplies no Copilot paid proof.

The first profile-13 source (`f5c5fde38`) built a fresh ARM daemon and Pi pack,
then passed original startup and all 61 native/ACP contract tests without model
calls. Its full Runner suite found three missing-mode test fixtures and the
stale Copilot declaration. Those failures are retained. The corrected final
source still requires fresh platform builds, complete checks, and paid tests.

Profile 12 passed one paid local hello through the actual installed public
CLI/server and normal runtime setup. The next question-continuation case failed
at the unchanged 120-second native deadline: Pi emitted 1,019 reasoning deltas,
but no tool call or question. The tool and schema were present. One native turn
was submitted; the two visible start rows were canonical and mirrored activity,
not evidence of two provider requests. Both attempts completed owned-process,
IPC, temporary-root, installed-inventory, and post-run accounting checks.

The dedicated key recorded $0.000510742 for the hello and $0.004995065 for the
failed question. Including the earlier profile-11 failure ($0.000142518), its
observed total was $0.005648325 at that reconciliation. These are observed key
usage changes, not native per-request bills. No failed result has been regraded.

Diagnosis found that the runner did not select the ACP reasoning mode. The
pinned model's implicit Pi `medium` setting resolves to `high`; this behavior
also existed in Pi 0.84.2. Pi 1.0 exposes a genuine `low` level. Profile 13 carries
an explicit setting through configuration, transport, and durable identity,
and requires the native effective level to match before a prompt is sent.
It does not increase the timeout. The timed-out HTTP body was not captured,
so source-derived default mapping does not establish the cause of that failure.
Fresh qualification must use the new profile and exact final build.

Historical source `4c58da84fd86a0cd7bc1d952987b031786fc6b2b` passed full Runner
verification and normal Intel startup at 28.295 seconds under the original
30-second limit, plus all 48 native/ACP contract tests. The Intel result has
only 1.705 seconds of margin and does not establish broad cold-start reliability.
Its fresh Linux daemon, Pi pack, and image were built and inventoried; live
Daytona qualification remained pending. The public Mac installation reproduced
the complete Pi dependency closure using npm 11.19.0 from the verified Node
archive. None of these artifacts qualifies profile 13.

The same source's full repository check failed six stale test assertions and
an `ETXTBSY` binary-staging error; the downstream Grok check then lacked built
server output. Typecheck, token gates, and Product E2E typecheck/unit checks
passed. The stale assertions have targeted repairs. A Linux process owner was
not captured for `ETXTBSY`; two exact native fixtures later passed on ARM with
all owned daemon handles closed, which does not resolve the Linux failure.
The next complete source run retains bounded executable-holder evidence around
check boundaries. A later run on obsolete harness source was canceled by the
lead and is retained as incomplete, not successful verification.

Normal Daytona setup has an explicit operator command to import a verified
Linux companion into the installed server. It binds the trusted manifest to the
installed source, Pi profile, daemon, and complete provider-pack inventory, then
uses ordinary remote execution without test-only binary or pack overrides.
The final installed import, image publication, and paid proof remain required.

The dedicated Pi test key has a $5 lifetime OpenRouter-credit limit. Its BYOK
charges are outside that provider-enforced limit, so qualification additionally
uses the reviewed no-BYOK operational policy, fresh account/key evidence, one
paid case at a time, and usage monitoring. The $5 reservation is counted once
within the combined $100 campaign budget. Native price estimates are never
substituted for provider bills.

The [Pi capability inventory](runner-pi-capabilities.md#historical-pi-10-candidate-2026-10-02-profile-v13)
records native interfaces, ACP mappings, user surfaces, and explicit gaps.
The comparison below remains the supported-surface map; old observations retain
their exact historical profile identities. Final source checks and profile-13
local Product, Runner protocol, native-control, and Daytona qualification remain
pending.

Historical source checkpoint (2026-10-01): **Cursor v10, Copilot v12 and Pi v10
remain unqualified**. Copilot receipt v2 distinguishes original provider
arguments from the validated outgoing completion input. The sidecar commits
the captured normalized digest only after its exact pending call receives a
successful, turn-bound `tool.resolve`. Pipe-write success alone is insufficient:
Rust may reject a frame at its smaller payload admission limit. Errors,
cancellation, timeout and stale responses cannot attest delivery.

Delivery remains separate from canonical equality and acceptance. The grader
still requires the normalized digest to match the unique proposed and accepted
result bodies. Oversized frames and Unicode repair fail before commitment;
dropped frames do not consume stream sequence numbers. The server preserves
only the fixed schema literal inside a validated semantic-receipt notice.
The failed v10 Daytona attempt and held v11 builds remain historical. Fresh
v12 runtime packaging and local/Daytona evidence are required. The
[Copilot inventory](runner-copilot-capabilities.md) records these boundaries.

Historical source checkpoint (2026-10-01): **Cursor v10, Copilot v10 and Pi v10
remain unqualified**. Cursor now shares the bounded native tool-ID mapping
across sidecar activity and permissions, then deterministically joins that key
to the canonical opaque execution ID. Copilot correlates native tool results with
authenticated, turn-bound semantic receipts instead of display names. Both new
profile identities reject v9 warm sessions. Their native distribution bytes
are unchanged; new sidecar assets, runner admission digests and fresh local/Daytona
qualification are required. The [Cursor](runner-cursor-capabilities.md) and
[Copilot](runner-copilot-capabilities.md) inventories describe the new contracts,
the Copilot 256 KiB output limit and the credential-free native proof scope.
Pi remains blocked on a verifiable OpenRouter spending cap. Prior paid failures
and case-specific passes remain historical; none is regraded by these fixes.
The controller now dispatches bridged requests in durable notification order.
It consumes earlier activity before presenting a request, while a pending human
answer does not prevent later activity from streaming. A genuine permission-first
provider sequence remains permission-first.

Historical source checkpoint (2026-09-30): **Cursor v9, Copilot v8 and Pi v10
remain unqualified**. All three declarations bind shared ACPX patch SHA-256
`bd5393058a218040d217fa85449d59a6f30507de54cd645bf0ef21422823f85e`.
Cursor additionally binds newly materialized `paperclip-cursor-usage-v4` closures;
Copilot and Pi native distribution bytes are unchanged. The new identities reject
retained 7/7/9 sessions, plus Cursor v8 sessions. Claude, Codex and Grok profile declarations stay unchanged.
The metadata is observation-only: native counters always remain partial, absent
fields stay absent, and no token totals or dollar costs are inferred. A supported
schema does not prove native counter aggregation semantics. No new paid pass,
build, publication or production qualification is claimed for these identities.
External eval definitions for 8/8/10 merged in [#35](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip-evals/pull/35)
as `25303cf84953985b961b95f89aff0bdb864b2d65`, from head
`b4ef1aa1296f8897714325d189e5a6f51dad9e01`: 136 deterministic tests,
21 validated cells, passing CI and Apex 5/5. Models, pricing and graders are
unchanged; this adds no paid proof. Those definitions remain the historical
Cursor v8 checkpoint and require a separate reviewed Cursor v9 update.

Historical checkpoint (2026-09-30): **Cursor v9, Copilot v8 and Pi v10 remain unqualified.** The frozen runtime is `5c69b69ef2aeab8d8a367b25a8d894cc5308befa`; controller candidate is `a8df2064d68f40fbf4dec670c4b8478c4b1b1b3f`. All profiles bind shared ACPX patch SHA-256 `bd5393058a218040d217fa85449d59a6f30507de54cd645bf0ef21422823f85e`. No profile is promoted and no prior grade is changed.

Current-profile protocol eval definitions merged in [paperclip-evals #36](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip-evals/pull/36) as `d987357461933baca0d4c10cc081f40e7eae5c1b`: 136 deterministic tests and 21 validated cells. These definitions do not supply paid qualification evidence.

| Profile | Latest status |
| --- | --- |
| Cursor v9 | Draft #14724 at `3adee6f3fc652d5f5ee40b2061a16cea0c7341f5`; Apex 5/5 and 51 checks plus one context are green. Eval-notice preservation is fixed for future runs. The strict accounting failure remains; native USD is unknown. Local/Daytona qualification remains pending. |
| Copilot v8 | Current warm attempt passed all 9 Product matchers and daemon invariants; overall supervisor failed final-pack cleanup on an extra executable. That exact orphan was later retired safely; the original grade stays failed. Daytona denial observed no write, but normal provider completion failed the original cancellation fixture; later checks were not graded. Database timestamps do not establish visibility before Stop; the earlier ordering inference is withdrawn. The 5c69 warm-PID failure is a separate historical grade. |
| Pi v10 | Capped-key/login access remains blocked. Native USD is unknown; fresh exact-runtime qualification remains pending. |

Shutdown ownership [#14730](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/pull/14730), head `d09ed62b6`, has Apex 5/5 and all 52 checks green. Denial settlement [#14733](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/pull/14733), head `1b47b30be`, passes 220 focused tests and E2E typecheck; fresh review and CI are pending. Suite v4 retains exact API evidence before dispatching Stop; database timestamps are descriptive only, and neither accepted settlement branch proves active-turn cancellation. Final-source verification and fresh paid qualification remain pending. Sidecars rotate by `attach_run`, a separate ACPX authority behavior from daemon continuity.

Cursor's verified fixed $25 account-cycle cap resets October 28 and applies to account on-demand fees, not per-cell costs. Its separate 15-test helper proposal is unintegrated and grants no launch authority. Pi's capped-key prerequisite remains unresolved; the optional helper is not integrated. Account-control review SHA-256: `0b661e38043759b5569a586dea57160926a361367c779bfe0fb0080c122f3bdd`.

Latest Copilot attempt references: warm result `effadec7b6b134e3b31148cf7eea3c2b24d37ee0fc6ce36dbc90ec420b171560`, reconciliation `1ad1788161e34abf7ddcda15e08134a4c80d1f0af176d7b5397ea6dd810dace0`; Daytona denial result `050a239b6d86754d0f0045979b7c343c007729528546b49f069e7396cd167b38`, reconciliation `2ef9834cd53345c03c04bbfec1ad0bba24a2de1d7096d9225acdfa185241b82a`.

Earlier current-profile case evidence (grades retained) is tied to Paperclip source `5c69b69ef2aeab8d8a367b25a8d894cc5308befa` and eval definitions `e4989bae1cedc36835da199826bf207d86b75761`. Copilot v8 protocol coverage totals seven cells: six passed and one behavior failure. The earlier `get_task_context` cell passed (result SHA-256 `7a30ad3de932f7e1bc3c3c3c766d8aa128c7003b35447ac0c73ef5f1f36914c0`); the remaining-batch reconciliation records five passes and one failure (SHA-256 `0e746a85e529a2fd45da4e553062753eabc1d8cb37d701529c5bc030a200cb81`). The `context-before-action` failure called `report_progress` before `get_task_context` and generated two comments. No native per-run USD was available; estimated model cost is separate. In local warm continuity, all nine matchers across three turns matched, but the candidate failed the stable-process requirement after observing three runner PIDs (result SHA-256 `e05e1af41a0c43396e8297ca0ac670065ff1f20bf3ce343930d5f45139277ed6`). For the Daytona permission-denial attempt, the recorded sandbox state was `building_snapshot` when the fixture lease wait expired, before the native permission operation or lease. That state can include queueing or image pulling; the evidence does not prove a snapshot was actually being built (result SHA-256 `fb928929a578403943707544e770ddc6ababe358c344a33c4af9028406804407`; state receipt SHA-256 `e32e5bf9b6ee18e8c2a4cb97436ceac7974b0fe1ed7cce02dae4ad2d3d58d875`). The later a8df attempt is recorded in the current checkpoint above; these earlier artifact grades remain unchanged and do not establish complete provider qualification.

Cursor v9's current `get_task_context` cell passed four behavior checks, only one of which asserts a semantic operation. Root reconciliation classifies the attempt as `accounting_failure_account_bounded`, but the capture did not retain the bounded v4 usage envelope: the usage ledger was empty, the retained artifact records `provider_did_not_report_usage`, and native counters were not inspected. There is no usable provider aggregate or estimated cost, so this capture cannot live-qualify partial v4 diagnostics. The case and provider remain unqualified, and no native per-run USD is inferred. Result SHA-256 `7968dc62496feca03a7def6ee20b95ba825d42e9a98f1b6b763ccb8a263b35f4`; root reconciliation SHA-256 `3558c09a839a8aaf9a34970fb793e9c84ff8ca3c125f9543da9c208d4323c54f`.
A later live-eval recorder review found that generic mapping and evidence fallback drop `paperclip/canonicalProviderEvent`. This identifies a recorder loss path; the prior artifact does not prove that the provider emitted the diagnostic, so the existing `accounting_failure_account_bounded` result and its accounting failure remain unchanged. Draft Paperclip PR [#14724](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/pull/14724), targeting #14699, is at head `3adee6f3fc652d5f5ee40b2061a16cea0c7341f5`. Its non-native suite passed 73 tests with one explicit native exclusion. The initial Apex review identified two P1 issues, subsequently repaired and re-reviewed at the current head above. Evidence `cursor-eval-notice-fix/APEX-REPAIR-01.json` records `nativeExecuted: false` and `oldPaidFailuresRegraded: false` (SHA-256 `a792c3979e4a33801d44974b32fa9078294ec650641ca4e23b1b28212a62659e`). This TS-only repair does not establish deploy-pack or native-runtime reusability: the whole provider deploy pack includes live/eval files and its digest would change; native equalities remain unproven.

Startup preparation on controller `a8df2064d68f40fbf4dec670c4b8478c4b1b1b3f` with frozen runtime `5c69b69ef2aeab8d8a367b25a8d894cc5308befa` first failed because the frozen offline install recreated `node_modules` without the excluded Daytona workspace plugin-SDK link. The narrow `link-plugin-dev-sdk` export restored one symlink and its owned parent. The subsequent preparation digest is `b824a5dde48c94a7c64f2be273b1b03508bdbbd55dbc7cfe63a45a19371b0fd7`; readiness receipt `product-readiness.pending.json` SHA-256 `60fa994d929851670ce29d2dfb2cb773a06ee9e0c037142ccda44fb6e522a9d9` passed health, recovery, UI and plugin checks, retired 32 owned PIDs and observed clear IPC. Root review digest is `4be4f8ce295457b50c69683417bd3883b101089a994bae59be518fe781bf97ce`. This is setup evidence only: zero provider or cloud calls, not provider qualification.


The preceding PR workflow on candidate `a027895ea66ac74578ff677d4c555c263773c0a7` ended with nine jobs reporting the same runner shutdown signal at approximately 13:50 UTC, followed by cancellation. Bounded job logs show no explicit failed-test summary, so this is recorded as runner interruption evidence, not a product qualification result or source-test failure. Final PR review snapshot (2026-09-30): paperclip/paperclip #14696 at exact head `9dbf9ae0d030d837a9a4d9241967ff5d3d5c974e` has 52/52 checks green. Greptile Apex reviewed that exact head at 5/5 with no new findings; all eight existing Greptile review threads are resolved. This confirms the PR review state only; provider production qualification remains pending. The preparation review itself records that no paid authority was granted (receipt `protocol-preparation/root-preparation-review.json`, SHA-256 `a716c6bb1d31a7c5bd6547d9295ac8b133f4ad86ab8fccf53683c3b92cab5dac`).

Cursor's native-question report has a [public upstream review finding](https://forum.cursor.com/t/agent-acp-never-offers-the-askquestion-tool-so-cursor-ask-question-is-never-sent/172976): the reported missing AskQuestion behavior was attributed to server-side ACP session identification, with no missing initialize capability identified and no verified fix release in the visible thread. This is diagnostic evidence, not confirmation that the pinned Cursor distribution supports the callback in every mode or proof that it is universally absent. Evidence identity: `root-findings.json`, SHA-256 `2fc34c1942e85ab58577b7cfa8ccdeafe520cc7c539aa67a7eef5a474848ad73`.

The existing provider inventories remain the source for methods, events, projections and explicit gaps. Optional native artifact, diff and every-mode surfaces remain listed as gaps; they are not blanket qualification blockers for unrelated declared scope. No support declaration changes here.

The following checkpoint and chronology retain their original source/profile
identities; their builds and paid outcomes do not qualify the new candidates.

## Historical qualification checkpoint — September 30, 2026, after 64 attempts

All three providers remain unqualified. The retained paid baseline is Cursor v7,
Copilot v7 and Pi v9, with native runtime source `5b8e4454ef0bf12d0bb068c2e41d8c9df9356a1c`.
Controller and Product harness revisions are recorded independently below.
New usage-projection source is under development and has no paid qualification.

| New retained evidence | Outcome and boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Cursor v7 Daytona hello, controller3d21 | Six Product checks passed. One owned sandbox was deleted and remained absent through the late-create observation; local processes and temporary roots retired. Post-run authority passed. This qualifies only this case. |
| Copilot v7 Daytona denial, controller40064, attempt02 | Failed remote observer startup before permission proof. Cleanup confirmed removal of the owned sandbox and local processes. Original end source-checkout audit failed because the checkout moved during its final audit; an additive audit after exact restoration passed, without regrading the failed attempt. |
| Cursor v7 protocol get-task-context | All four semantic checks passed, but the unchanged eval rejected missing usage/cost coverage. No usage receipt or priced estimate was available. Preserve accounting_failure. |
| Copilot v7 seven-case protocol suite | Six cases passed: task context, document creation, task completion, human confirmation, context/document/progress workflow and governed waiting. Context-before-action failed: progress was committed before the context read. Both calls succeeded and six of seven checks in that case passed. State history confirms ordering; no grader or projection defect was established. No automatic retries. |

Protocol cases use the seeded mock control plane; they do not qualify browser,
Daytona or production mutations. Copilot estimates for all seven measured cases
have complete token-price coverage, while native billed dollars remain unknown.
The failed orientation case is a model-behavior result, not an infrastructure
retry candidate. The five final independent cases passed 35 checks in total.

The remote observer fix in [#14696](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/pull/14696)
sends a small nonce-bound snapshot request instead of forwarding its source code
over an 8 KiB control socket. The exact latest source `a1145db4d8dbde17e624f8a14ef2726b33d09083`
passes Apex 5/5 and CI. Its 41 deterministic tests include generated install,
snapshot and close traffic; negative tests require actual directory creation and
socket listening. It still needs live proof in the combined controller candidate.

The warm-directory review identified stable projectless scope, Darwin path
aliases, current lease ownership, stopped-versus-destroyed recovery, and composed
remote coverage gaps. New composed tests also exposed transfer scratch inside
AGENT_HOME, stale first-lease callbacks during handoff and compact receipts losing
the original materialization root. The corrected source passed 541 pure tests, direct server typecheck and all 63
selected database-backed cases (49 directory-service and 14 composed remote
scenarios), with owned process/IPC/temporary-root cleanup verified. These repairs
are awaiting a fresh commit review in [#14695](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/pull/14695). Earlier failing DB and
paid attempts remain retained; neither source tests nor session-ID reuse alone
prove paid warm process continuity.

Review follow-up `84a50124a997f4256932eab15fe79dd9ce875940` bounds immediate
collection retries and preserves pending ownership after a failed stop through
generic run cleanup. A later confirmed close or independent current-run stop
proof can collect the retained files. Its 547 pure tests, 65 database-backed
cases and direct server typecheck pass; owned process, IPC and temporary-root
cleanup completed. Fresh Apex and CI are pending. This adds no paid warm proof.

Cursor's pinned native `TurnEndedUpdate` has optional input, output, cache-read,
cache-write and reasoning counters. Its vendor ACP prompt response does not
project them. No evidence shows Paperclip dropped a supplied ACP usage receipt in
the failed attempt. The new candidate records bounded per-invocation observations
as explicitly partial diagnostics. It must not sum parent/child totals, invent
missing zeros or claim billing until the backend's aggregation/cache/reasoning
semantics and exact selected model pricing are verified. JSON-RPC errors do not
return this diagnostic envelope; reused child runs lack unambiguous callback
attribution. Those are explicit gaps, not complete accounting. The shared patch
changes identity declarations, requiring new Cursor/Copilot/Pi candidate identities
and new qualification; prior receipts remain bound to their original runtime.

The private ledger has 64 closed records and no active paid invocation. Latest
Copilot account observation: Pro active, 23/1,500 included credits used, additional
usage disabled at $0. Latest Cursor observation: Pro+, fixed account-wide $25 cap,
$0 on-demand observed. These account totals may lag and are not per-run invoices.
Known Pi API cost is $0.040507624; the conservative retained infrastructure upper
bound is $0.635265. Cursor's entire $25 cap remains reserved globally. Unknown
native or infrastructure invoice totals remain unknown; no combined actual-spend
total is inferred. The $100 campaign ceiling remains in force. Pi v9 still needs
an enforceable provider spending bound before further paid calls.

Evidence references (private attempts remain inspectable without publishing raw
provider transcripts): Cursor Daytona hello result `3ec06ed1aee8a5523262d4855dca3483de24139480da76f37d75a38570ecb843`;
Copilot denial02 result `048ec74bedf508080a099ea6be39f5d4ec159f31985dbe4c52f286a8f8813021`;

## Historical checkpoint before the latest 11 attempts

The following source and cost observations are retained historical checkpoints;
the dated qualification checkpoint above states the current result.

Updated: 2026-09-30 UTC. **Cursor v7, Copilot v7 and Pi v9 remain unqualified.** Paid controller and Product harness source is recorded per case: `40064d28522de25fea85c1297f35b41bb8a8897a` or `3d21d375de2b6249d9f5322bf001ce0ce0e052aa`. Native runtime source remains `5b8e4454ef0bf12d0bb068c2e41d8c9df9356a1c`. Runtime builds for macOS ARM64, macOS x64 and Linux x64 are complete. The corrected 3d21 controller uses unchanged compiled UI/package outputs built on 40064; it executes the controller TypeScript from 3d21. These distinct source roles do not relabel the runtime or older failures.

Exact-head CI and Greptile now pass for Cursor `c58a8881f2cb771b35e19e1bf56e08cb89397e83` (53 successful checks, two skips, Greptile 5/5) and Copilot `3d21d375de2b6249d9f5322bf001ce0ce0e052aa` (54 successes, four skips, Greptile 5/5). Copilot's first server-shard run timed out in an unchanged legacy Cursor test; an isolated reproduction and one failed-job rerun passed. Superseded cancelled checks are not failures. The new warm-directory fix needs its own full checks and live proof. Foundation [#14430](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/pull/14430) and Runner Eval definitions [#33](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip-evals/pull/33) are merged. The v7/v7/v9 definition update [#34](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip-evals/pull/34) merged as `52f6e897c08d236776a21723257e12c909d71137`, with 136 deterministic tests and 21 validated cells. These definitions are not paid proof. Provider PRs remain drafts.

| Current-profile paid case | Exact outcome and evidence limit |
| --- | --- |
| Cursor local native-plan reject/revise/accept, controller40064 | Failed passive settlement despite 21 passing bridge checks. Workspace snapshots stayed empty; cleanup and end integrity passed. Original failure is retained. |
| Cursor local native-plan reject/revise/accept, controller3d21 | All 26 checks passed after the canonical contract-hash repair. Rejection feedback reached the revised plan; the browser accepted that exact revision. The single planning run succeeded and the task stayed In Progress with an explicit wait for the next user message. No implementation or task completion is claimed. Workspace bytes remained unchanged through cleanup. |
| Copilot local attached async, controller40064 | Eight checks passed: one exact command, trusted child exit, native-client and independent-marker observations before terminal settlement, one run and one final marker. Done was visible. |
| Copilot local native denial, controller40064 | Ten checks passed: exact browser denial, no target side effect through process retirement, no alternate native operation, and correlated cancellation. The task remained unfinished as required. |
| Copilot local three-turn warm continuity, controller40064 | Nine behavioral checks passed, but the case failed because all three turns used different runner processes. Session-ID reuse alone is not warm process continuity. |
| Copilot Daytona hello, controller40064 | Six checks passed on profile7 and the current immutable Linux image. One owned sandbox was removed, the full late-create observation passed, and all owned local processes retired. This qualifies only this case. |
| Copilot Daytona denial, controller40064, first attempt | Failed before Product dispatch because the private launcher omitted the required image Node and runnerd digest environment fields. Account/analytics reads occurred, but the launch path never reached a provider or sandbox creation. The original failure remains failed; a corrected helper needs a new attempt. |

All passing cases above completed their owned process/semaphore cleanup, temporary-root cleanup and full end integrity audit. Cursor plan result SHA-256: `685609f01291db84f40d890ef562473b95065e86907bd964b656ad732f6dd97a`; reconciliation: `09a17d5aabc9d33bd7cfe083ad4875ed4da2c3d7b72438e00584237fc71190bc`. Copilot Daytona hello result: `960c9de5a78f4073918daed8f6f6ddfe6f90d1164bbb4cf8f2b4e3d20d5234a5`; reconciliation: `fd043e08b853e0a49901070593940a1aca68f8bd488c194578e6a3f65963d69e`. Copilot warm failure result: `1583d442c5bf70ea520fd63b3a6dcc03ba045a8af2af5e2f68dcf220bb4e8815`. Local async and denial result digests remain `d1d074bc9df4644794dfa8b020fdeba8a9b0de4618e1f55d1845f7726a2ece33` and `c1fd910ecc4bf9d6df7645f3eb90b45d9cc895cfea9e2f93b4cfdf8a2caf8625`.

The warm-directory repair retains the exact registered `AGENT_HOME` with the native owner, claims it before composing the next turn, and transfers collection authority with database compare-and-swap guards. Changes or a final configuration mismatch require verified retirement before collection. Missing stop proof preserves unresolved ownership. Stop-proved remote recovery records an explicit unavailable/no-save outcome when bytes cannot be recovered. Independent review found and fixed that recovery transition. Validation passed 527 native/probe tests, 63 working-copy database tests, four final composed lifecycle cases, five follow-up recovery cases, and direct server typecheck. The paid warm failure remains failed until a new run proves this change. See [agent-file lifecycle rules](../agent-files.md).

Native Cursor/Copilot per-run USD remains unknown. Cursor's fixed account-wide on-demand cap is $25, with $0 observed after the corrected plan case. Copilot additional usage remains disabled at $0; the included-credit counter reached 20 after Daytona hello and stayed 20 after the failed denial launch. Counters may lag. The hello sandbox's conservative cost bound is $0.086931; early analytics are provisional. The first 53 reservations are closed, retaining failed attempts. Pi v9 still needs a verifiable OpenRouter spending cap; its optional transport-budget candidate remains frozen and unintegrated. The $100 combined campaign ceiling remains in force.

The [prior evidence checkpoint](runner-rich-acp-validation-2026-09-30-current.json) retains controller/harness `ca7026182c2b861e3badbcb7e5b733445a6ee403` and runtime `e822b614fc368043f4b3d5e34a8d9bbda644e055`; despite its filename, it is historical for the current source. The [earlier September 30 checkpoint](runner-rich-acp-validation-2026-09-30.json) is also historical. Original failures, unknown costs and exact source/profile identities remain unchanged.

| Gate recorded at the historical checkpoint | Required evidence or decision |
| --- | --- |
| Cursor v7 | The exact corrected local native-plan case passed; complete the remaining required cases. Native AskQuestion availability remains unverified; semantic questions cannot substitute for its callback. Complete the required local/Daytona native input, permission, recovery, isolation and warm-continuity cases. |
| Copilot v7 | Local attached-async and native-denial plus Daytona hello passed. Repair and requalify failed warm process continuity; broader provider qualification remains pending. Complete the remaining local/Daytona denial, recovery, isolation and warm-continuity cases. Explicit detached work remains unsupported. Native external-tool/sampling/limits callbacks require proof that admitted tools cannot leave an unresolved request, or a qualified responder. |
| Pi v9 | Obtain an enforced provider spending bound, then run the unchanged required local/Daytona cases against the exact model and final runtime. Historical controls, question and hello passes do not qualify v9. |
| All providers | Bind every required case to exact controller/runtime/profile and platform evidence, retain failures, complete source/dependency/pack end audits and owned cleanup, and reconcile actual spend within the $100 ceiling. CI and packaging do not substitute for this paid evidence; native Cursor/Copilot per-run USD remains unknown. |

The field inventories and [prioritized follow-ups](#historical-gaps-and-follow-ups--october-2-2026) distinguish native SDK/RPC capability, ACP exposure and Paperclip projection. Image inputs, structured tool diffs/media/raw arguments, secondary locations and typed exit codes remain partial or unused in the common path. Cursor's richer child details and discovery/configuration fields, Copilot's session-scoped files/assets and uncorrelated native notices, and Pi's queue-delivery/configuration fields remain explicit follow-ups. These optional surfaces are not silently claimed as supported or treated as new blockers for unrelated declared cases. Copilot native steering/fork/ask-user APIs do not imply ACP responders; Pi native fork/clone/export likewise have no mapped runner controls. Pi confirm reports `negative_or_cancelled` because No and dismissal are indistinguishable; accepted empty or whitespace-only input/editor responses are not representable by the current canonical form.

| Retained paid observation | Outcome and limit |
| --- | --- |
| Cursor v6 Daytona hello, runtime/controller e822 | Six Product matchers passed. Root reconciled the original supervisor cleanup-tail failure using the retained absent sandbox, retired processes and passing integrity audit. Infrastructure upper bound: $0.086931; analytics are provisional. This proves one cell. |
| Copilot v6 local native denial, controller415/runtimee822 | Ten Product checks passed: delivered denial, correlated native failure, zero target mutations, explicit Stop, cancellation and owned cleanup. An additive screenshot-reader correction used the original evidence without a model retry. This historical v6 case passed; it does not qualify v7. |
| Cursor v6 local native plan, controller415/runtimee822 | All 21 native bridge checks passed, including reject, feedback, revision, exact acceptance and reconnect. The case failed because a normal planning stop had no semantic task-completion result. [Draft #14669](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/pull/14669) adds a passive in-progress wait for the next user message. Its later paid attempt is recorded below. |
| Cursor v6 local native plan, controllerca702/runtimee822 | All 21 native bridge checks passed again. The case failed because the plan's own tool started after its input callback, while the runner had dropped the tool identity needed to distinguish it from unrelated work. Workspace snapshots stayed empty; no second run was observed. Native completion succeeded, but controller settlement failed. All owned processes retired and the full integrity audit passed. Cursor v7 binds the exact tool lifecycle; its later paid settlement failure is recorded above. This failed case is not regraded. |
| Copilot v6 attached-command settlement, controller415/runtimee822 | Failed supervision: incomplete IPC observation stopped an accepted turn. A later scanner match was a static UI demo string. The owned processes retired; an exact temporary executable copy was separately removed and the full pack audit passed. The original failed observation remains failed. |
| Copilot v6 attached-command settlement, controller81/runtimee822 | A new authenticated attempt reached task Done, but one leading ASCII space changed the native command digest. A fixture-only correction now permits a bounded leading SPACE/TAB prefix and retains both digests. The original case remains failed: independent settlement observations were not captured before that assertion, and two provider text bursts produced a doubled final marker. The source investigation confirmed that the pinned ACP mapper drops native message IDs. [Draft #14676](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/pull/14676) preserves them in a separately versioned Copilot v7 candidate; no equal-text deduplication is applied. Cleanup, complete IPC observation and the full end integrity audit passed. Included-credit observations changed 15→16; extra usage stayed disabled at $0. A visible Done status alone does not qualify command settlement. |

Fresh source81 controller startup, recovery, static UI/plugin admission and local/remote credential-free preflights passed. Native builds retain e822 provenance on macOS ARM64, macOS x64 (Rosetta), and Linux x64. Exact restoration of seven missing empty Cursor directories recovered the original ARM64 and Linux pack digests without changing files or expected inventories. Analogous omissions in the retained Linux build stage and macOS-x64 pack/stage still need restoration and verification before their next use; the actor is unknown. No additional platform qualification is inferred.

Exact source415 CI completed with 53 successful checks/statuses and two skips; Greptile reviewed that head at 5/5. Local recursive typecheck, build and token gates passed. The original broad test command failed. Its four server failures and two CLI timeouts passed unchanged in isolated follow-ups. Resumed workspace checks exposed stale installed ACPX patch metadata: a private qualification-install overlay corrects seven patch-hash references. Repository policy assigns the source lockfile to the refresh bot, so commit `788e3b88ffe0e66e632fc2811087036dbb756f49` restores the exact tracked bytes from before the attempted metadata-only edit. A fresh frozen install, exact patched vendor-byte verification, four long-diagnostic cases and 25 actual package contracts pass. Some manually resumed commands also collected generated `dist` test duplicates; those invocation failures remain recorded separately. The source Codex auth timeout passed unchanged when isolated. The serialized command stopped on two import tests; both passed unchanged in isolation. All 110 unrun suites finished separately: 109 files and 2,046 tests passed, while one cache-bound test failed after its five-second TTL elapsed. That case passed unchanged in one narrow rerun. The final source415 checkout receipt is clean. No passing full-local gate is claimed.

At parent source `6b1e96af0`, CI reported 49 successes, two skips and four failures, including the E2E aggregate. Commit `f401b831f` moves cold route imports into fixture setup and dismisses the actual announcement UI in the attachment browser test. All 26 route tests passed. The attachment test also passed with a forced real announcement and a successful dismissal response. Parent source `aec34c693` then completed CI with 53 successes and two skips. The separate preview-runtime CI stall passed unchanged under local instrumentation; its cause is unconfirmed, and no speculative runtime fix is included.

Cursor v7 source `770dc88a1` preserves the native plan's parent tool identity through TypeScript, the sidecar and Rust. The controller requires one successful lifecycle for that exact tool in the same session and turn, and includes its events in the committed proof. It rejects unrelated work and altered proof. Historical Cursor v6 committed waits remain valid. All 228 focused tests, the Runner TypeScript build and server typecheck pass. Native distribution bytes are unchanged; current runtime builds are complete, and the corrected controller3d21 paid native-plan case above passed.

Copilot v7 source `70b186b3c` preserves real native message identity through the pinned mapper and separates intermediate messages from the final answer. The native executable is unchanged; an owned, verified inner distribution carries the patch. Review fixes add owned-output rollback after failed materialization and actual ACPX history replay coverage before fresh warm turns. All 49 focused JavaScript/TypeScript checks, Runner typecheck and the exact Rust admission check pass. The earlier source passed 212 focused tests and verified complete closures for all three platforms; only ARM64 executed its native loopback proof. That asset evidence remains separate from the current source checks. Current runtime builds and exact-head CI are recorded above; fresh remote image/admission evidence and the remaining paid qualification are separate gates. The earlier v6 async failure stays failed.

Cursor native AskQuestion remains unverified for the inspected exact models/modes. Pi v9 needs a verifiable OpenRouter spending bound before further paid runs. Its optional transport-budget candidate remains frozen: production allocation, launch scope, warm rotation, packaging and Daytona transport are incomplete. The provider-capped key remains the immediate path. Native Cursor/Copilot per-run USD remains unknown. Included usage and a disabled overage budget are billing coverage, not a native price receipt. The first 53 attempt records are closed. The table above separates corrected Cursor plan and Copilot hello passes from retained failed plan, warm and launcher attempts. The $100 campaign authorization remains in force, including failed attempts and infrastructure.

Current profile identities bind shared runtime contract `paperclip.acpx-runtime-contract.v1`. All ACPX warm owners include that revision in their configuration fingerprint; incompatible owners retire without approval replay. Other transports retain their previous configuration digest. Legacy Cursor and Pi adapters remain unchanged.

## Historical v5/v5/v8 evidence

On source `5605c350b`, Cursor v5 passed all five basic paid local journeys: completion, semantic questions, semantic plan approval, controller restart, and file edit/validation. Copilot v5 passed paid Daytona completion. Pi v8 introduced message-boundary and bounded retry/compaction-notice repairs, but has no paid pass on that profile. None of these older receipts qualifies the current profile or its remaining local/Daytona roster.

On integrated source `65b19549e`, 389 focused Runner tests passed (one optional
native installation case skipped), 30 Rust ACPX unit tests passed, 19 selected
server mode/recovery tests passed, and Runner build/server typecheck passed.
The final ACPX patch also passed 22 actual package contracts against the locked
SDK 1.4.0 dependency graph. These are deterministic checks, not paid qualification
or a passing repository-wide gate. The first frozen install exposed a preexisting
legacy ACPX 0.12 patch-hash mismatch; a metadata-only correction passes frozen
lock validation with every dependency version unchanged.

Credential-free tests cover the new policy boundaries, real pinned native
processes, clean runtime builds and Product E2E assertions. On integrated source
`bd4cc29c3`, Cursor v4 has passed local hello, and Copilot v4 has passed all five
basic local journeys: hello, semantic questions, semantic plans, controller
restart and file edit/validation. Pi v7 has passed local hello on `807feaecf` and
Daytona hello on `bd4cc29c3`. Copilot also passed Daytona hello. Pi’s repaired
native-question evidence case passed 15/15; the following continuation case
exposed final-message aggregation of earlier narration.
These passes retain earlier failures and do not qualify native interactions,
all required platforms or the remaining remote journeys.

The [harness priorities report](https://pages.paperclip.ing/2026-09-25-harness-priorities/)
recommends Cursor and Copilot, followed by Pi, using the existing qualified ACPX
path. Codex app-server is the richness benchmark. The legacy Cursor and Pi
adapters are outside this change.

## Retained paid profile evidence (2026-09-29, collected through September 30 UTC)

This historical paid checkpoint used runtime source `5605c350b2a4dae75be3779f164d7e1a0e4a5a87`.
It includes the passive native-read evidence fix from `794e90a258`: correlation
uses a fixture-owned path digest and the runner's actual opaque tool identity,
without weakening native permission checks. The 155 focused projector/Product
tests passed. The later Cursor identity fix and its regression coverage are
described below. Source, executable, dependency and profile identities are bound
to each retained run; documentation and unrelated test-only follow-ups do not
relabel the executable source.

| Paid case and runtime source | Result | Cost coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cursor v5 local `hello-complete`, `5605c350b` | One authenticated run; all six matchers and the saved-mode qualification check passed; 76.202 seconds including supervision | Matching 39K-token account row is Included; on-demand remains $0 with the approved fixed $25 cap |
| Cursor v5 local `question-resume-complete`, `5605c350b` | Two authenticated runs on the same session; six matchers passed; answered question and Done visible; 99.186 seconds including supervision | Matching 58.4K and 24.6K-token account rows are Included; on-demand remains $0 |
| Cursor v5 local `plan-approve-complete`, `5605c350b` | Two authenticated runs; six matchers passed; displayed plan revision 1, approval and completion visible; 98.064 seconds including supervision | Matching 61.8K and 51.4K-token account rows are Included; on-demand remains $0 |
| Cursor v5 local `structured-question-restart-resume`, `5605c350b` | Two authenticated runs; six matchers passed; pending question survives controller restart and resumes the same session after the answer; 72.360 seconds including supervision | Matching 60.9K and 25.9K-token account rows are Included; on-demand remains $0 |
| Cursor v5 local `file-edit-validate`, `5605c350b` | One authenticated run; seven matchers passed, validated file and downloadable artifact visible; 66.805 seconds including supervision | Matching 166.2K-token account row is Included; on-demand remains $0 |
| Copilot v5 Daytona `hello-complete`, `5605c350b` | Browser/public-API journey passed six matchers in 82.859 seconds; authenticated semantic finish produced the exact completion marker and Done; exact sandbox destruction and the 360-second late-create observation passed | Additional usage is disabled with a $0 budget. Compute/storage upper bound is $0.086931 for this cell; individual sandbox analytics remain provisional, not zero cost |
| Cursor v5 local `question-resume-complete`, earlier `794e90a258` | Two authenticated runs on the same session; six matchers passed; 62.006 seconds | Both matching account rows are Included; retained as earlier-source evidence |
| Copilot v5 local `question-resume-complete`, earlier `794e90a258` | Two authenticated runs on the same session; six matchers passed; 51.328 seconds | Included credits increased from 12 to 14; additional usage disabled with a $0 budget |
| Pi v8 | No paid run on this current runtime yet | The available OpenRouter key has no enforced limit or management access. A capped qualification key is pending account sign-in |

The five corrected-build Cursor cases retired every observed owned process,
left no owned semaphores and passed post-run authority checks. Screenshots,
durable events and original receipts are retained. All cases used zero automatic
retries. Native priced USD remains unavailable for Cursor and Copilot; included
usage is account billing coverage, not a fabricated native token price.
Paperclip semantic questions and plans do not qualify native provider callbacks.
The campaign remains provisional until its full end audit and required cases
pass.

The next Cursor native-question case failed: no `cursor/ask_question` callback
was observed before the turn ended. The model reported that `AskQuestion` was
unavailable, but the retained events contain no actual tool-catalog discovery;
this is unverified availability for the exact model/mode, not confirmed harness
absence. The pinned native extension handler passes an offline single-/multi-
select exercise and requires no extra question capability in ACP initialization.
No semantic question is substituted for this missing native evidence. Two
subsequent native-only probes admitted the exact Luna and Composer
`composer-2.5[fast=true]` models in Plan mode, verified trusted-instruction
acknowledgements, and exposed no MCP servers. Each submitted one prompt and
ended without a native question callback. Their matching account rows are
Included (14.4K and 14.6K tokens), with complete process/lease cleanup and no
on-demand charge. These diagnostics leave native-question availability
unverified; they do not qualify the Product interaction or prove harness-wide
absence. An earlier diagnostic failed before inference because its test launch
omitted the required instruction binding; that failed attempt is retained.
An offline reversal of all 14 vendor-patch replacements recovered the exact
pinned upstream chunk and reproduced the installed bytes. Native question
handlers, presentation and dispatch are unchanged. The local request-context
tool list contains MCP descriptors; native model tool selection crosses the
remote AgentService boundary. The effective remote tool catalog remains
unobserved, so no local patch removal or additional model sweep is justified.

The campaign's full end audit also failed. Earlier Daytona setup had installed
14,335 additional entries under the local plugin's `node_modules` using its
checked-in frozen lock. All 111,348 original dependency entries still match;
one SDK CLI file changed mode from 0600 to 0755 with unchanged contents when pnpm
linked its executable. The plugin also generated 60 build files outside the
original workspace inventory. These changes occurred after the original
inventory. The failed audit remains retained, and its behavioral passes do not
establish complete runtime qualification.

A separate source-identical preparation now materializes the complete frozen
plugin dependency/build closure and compiled static UI before inventory. It
disables automatic plugin builds and development middleware through supported
server settings. A credential-free admission reached healthy server/plugin
readiness, verified served UI bytes, and left all 131,613 dependency/workspace
entries unchanged. All 30 owned processes retired without owned semaphores.
The new full start audit passed; new paid cases use a separate binding and do
not retroactively qualify the failed campaign. Every case remains provisional
until its own required behavior and the new full end audit pass.

The first native plan case on this new preparation received and displayed the
complete `cursor/create_plan` request, including its revision and decision
options. The test did not answer it: its matcher required `acpx-runtime`, while
the legitimate sidecar emits `acpx-runtime-sidecar`. A second fixture assertion
compares JSON key order instead of structural equality. The unanswered session
timed out; the 149.418-second failed attempt, complete cleanup and passing full
end audit remain retained. Its 26.7K-token account row is Included. Fixture
commit `375cdf6e` accepts the two exact production ACPX origins and uses
structural equality; 880 fixture tests, fixture typecheck and replay against
the failed snapshot pass. Another explicitly bound attempt is required to
prove actual reject/revise/accept delivery.

Copilot's first supplemented native-denial case delivered the browser's decline
as `reject_once`, recorded failure of the same native tool, and retained absent
target samples. It still failed qualification: cancellation was acknowledged
without a terminal turn event or provider retirement, then the 120-second
timeout changed the run to failed. Its watcher also reported incomplete
coverage while monitoring a workspace parent that startup can modify. The
144.581-second attempt retired every owned process, left no owned semaphores,
and passed the full end audit; additional billing remained disabled at $0.
Shared cancellation settlement and explicit permission-provider provenance are
being repaired. Fixture commit `98a29fcf7` creates an isolated denied-target
parent before dispatch for local Copilot, Cursor and Pi. Its watcher retains
coverage failure reasons, parent identities and a bounded event journal; exact
native path correlation, complete observation and zero target mutation remain
required. All 80 focused fixture tests and fixture typecheck pass. Remote sealed
observers are unchanged. Paid runs are held until the corrected runtime is
identified and verified.

The Copilot cloud cell also retired all 46 observed local processes, restored
the host semaphore count from 321 to its baseline 310, removed its owned
temporary directory, and passed post-run authority checks. Its separate root
reconciliation records unknown native priced USD and a conservative cloud
ceiling; aggregate account analytics are not attributed to the test.

The subsequent Cursor v5 hello completed all six Product matchers, but the
stricter qualification reader correctly failed: the shared app-server facade
reconstructed the native provider identity without `cursorMode`. Native
admission retained the acknowledged mode; the server checkpoint lost it. The
campaign stopped after this one cell, all owned processes and semaphores were
retired, and the full end audit passed. Its 39.5K-token account row is Included.
The parser now validates and preserves Agent/Plan/Ask mode. Nine regressions
exercise actual driver checkpoint/recovery, changed or missing mode, and invalid
mode values; all 56 recovery/lifecycle tests and the Runner TypeScript build
pass. The corrected-build Cursor cases above now pass the same strict validator.
The original failed receipt remains a failure.

The most recent paid macOS ARM64 pack is
`sha256:3940fbe1c7b197b964b8f8182c1f1ae548cff822a95ecb4539e0ca851b4f2032`.
The rebuilt Linux x64 pack is
`sha256:83702fae11105f5b9ee8f9731b86dc06becb12075f68bdc98dcdfe9f9c842473`,
published and independently verified in
`ghcr.io/paperclipai/paperclip-daytona-runner@sha256:16c8be9c512c28cd9b16fe9ad5331f3fd7b58c42c382d3ebbe5897f658de0bea`.
The first Daytona setup attempt failed before browser fixture initialization,
provider inference or sandbox creation because the isolated HOME lacked a
Playwright browser-cache binding. Its failure remains retained. The explicit
verified cache binding passed a real private-HOME browser smoke before the
Copilot retry above. macOS x64 also has a corrected-source pack built under
Rosetta, reusing the previously verified daemon with identical Rust source;
this does not establish paid native Intel qualification.
Cursor's initialize probes needed forced cleanup after EOF, retained as a
settlement limitation rather than reported as graceful exit.

Current profile pins and prelaunch rejection checks are merged in
[paperclip-evals #32](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip-evals/pull/32),
with 142 deterministic tests and 21 selected cells across all three explicit
lanes. These definitions remain separate from authenticated qualification.

On prerequisite source `11b2842d`, recursive typecheck, token gates and build
pass. The initial server stage retained two database setup failures with 14,180
passing tests; both affected suites passed a focused retry after host recovery.
Segmented follow-up exercised the workspace projects and all 149 serialized
server suites. Initial stale-socket CLI failures, route-file failures, two legacy
ACPX 0.12 diagnostics and a Codex process-monitor timeout passed focused
rechecks with retries disabled and unchanged timeouts. The legacy installed
package needed corrected patch-hash metadata; the frozen offline install passed
and the checked-in lockfile was restored byte-for-byte. This is passing segmented
coverage, not a clean aggregate `pnpm test:run`. Local browser suites were not
rerun in this verification cycle; earlier Runner browser and CI evidence are
separate.

The Telegram recovery test's synthetic credential-lease fault affected another
company's Slack fixture. Its scope guard now has a failing negative control and
a passing Linux chat shard (356 passed, 710 skipped). At the September 30 UTC
checkpoint, prerequisite PR #14631 at `1cf7125b` has 52 successful and two
skipped checks; integration PR #14633 at `e154e853` has 51 successful checks.
Neither has failing or pending checks. A prior external-object mock assertion
and a runner-shutdown cancellation remain recorded; their exact-job reruns
passed. No provider is exposed as qualified on this evidence.

## Historical production checkpoint (2026-09-29)

The basic eval definitions and then-current profile pin follow-up merged in
`paperclip-evals` PRs [#29](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip-evals/pull/29)
and [#30](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip-evals/pull/30). The latter passed
134 unit tests, CI and Greptile 5/5 at `4a15550d16ced37c6edbafa91a11783a64e4e649`;
its merge commit is `0ad9c5a4275fbfbed3b32f261d3e603d9761a07c`. The Cursor/Copilot v4 and Pi v7 pin
update, including prelaunch profile admission, merged in
[PR #31](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip-evals/pull/31) at
`0b4b3932e95fe1685df5d523edff18c824fd3d54`. It passed 135 deterministic tests,
all three explicit lanes, current-head CI and Apex 5/5. These definitions
are not paid qualification results. Versioned config IDs separate current
candidate scorecards from historical runtime policies.

| Historical paid profile | Latest observed result | Remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cursor v4, source `2e0b0fec0`; paid runtime `bd4cc29c3` | All three closures verify; native instructions and bounded todos are implemented. Exact-head Apex reports 5/5. Current-profile local hello passed six matchers with one authenticated run, complete process cleanup and unchanged semaphore count | The question-resume case failed reopening its provider session; the following three cases were not launched. Rebuilt `627451ecf` passed question, plan and controller restart. Its file test validated the correct bytes but failed its exact response marker (5/7 matchers). Native callbacks, restrictive permissions, other platforms and Daytona remain unqualified. The approved account on-demand cap is $25 |
| Copilot v4, source `2042ca14c`; paid runtime `bd4cc29c3` | Native instruction delivery and lifetime ownership have deterministic proof. Exact-head Apex reports 5/5. All five basic local journeys passed; file edit/validation passed seven matchers in one run with complete cleanup | Daytona hello also passed six matchers with complete cleanup. Native permissions, attached background-command settlement, remaining remote workflows and other platforms remain open. The original session startup timeout is retained without a proven root cause |
| Pi v7, sources `807feaecf` and `bd4cc29c3` | Local hello on `807feaecf` and Daytona hello on `bd4cc29c3` passed six matchers each with zero retries and complete owned cleanup. Remote model plus sandbox analytics stabilized at $0.0053185282. Apex reports 5/5 on the reviewed provider head | The `bd4cc29c3` campaign passed hello, then failed packaging native-question evidence despite 15 passing behavioral checks. The harness-only repair subsequently passed all 15 native checks. The next continuation case failed final-message aggregation; five later cells did not launch. Remote/platform evidence remains incomplete |
| All three, Linux/Daytona | The immutable `bd4cc29c3` image and actual server artifact admission pass. Pi hello attempt 02 passed; failed attempt 01 remains retained | The host database resource blocker is repaired. Copilot’s retry passed six matchers and its exact sandbox remained absent for the full 360-second observation. Remaining remote cases are unqualified |

Cursor and Copilot ignore generic ACP `_meta.systemPrompt`; setting `AGENT_HOME`
in the process environment does not make it part of model instructions. The v4
profiles bind provider-specific delivery. Pi already uses its dedicated launch
configuration and owned `before_agent_start` extension. Offline source/SDK
checks use dependency doubles or synthetic model responses. They do not prove
final packaged, authenticated delivery. Cold restoration refreshes trusted context and instructions before reopening.
The shared continuation fix also allows a settled, authenticated new run to
refresh registered instruction/skill roots and its MCP binding. It preserves
profile, model, session, aggregate/context digests and all unknown policy fields;
same-run mutations and active-turn attachment remain rejected.

The repository-wide test attempt recorded 14,057 passed tests, eight failed
tests and two failed setup hooks in the first general-server group. All affected
cases and setup groups passed isolated retries. One retry selected no tests
because Vitest shortened a parameterized name; the corrected selector ran and
passed the case. A confirmed short-prefix collision in the chat test fixture is
repaired with bounded, constraint-specific allocation and three actual-database
regressions. The broad failed attempt remains retained; it is not converted into
a passing full run. On combined source `97217c531`, token gates, repository-wide
typecheck and build pass; its broad test run completed with 14,052 passing tests,
six failed tests and nine failed files (including collection failures). That
archive lacked Git metadata. A filtered private install also resolved Vitest
against unsupported Vite 6; four unchanged suites (116 tests) pass with its
intended Vite 8 dependency. Other broad-run failures remain retained rather
than being credited as passing.
On `807feaecf`, typecheck/build and CI reproduced a test-fixture typing error;
shared prerequisite commit `bb56af7fb` fixes it. These sources predate the latest
review and continuation fixes.
On integrated `bd4cc29c3`, full build, recursive typecheck and token gates pass.
The completed full test attempt records 11,598 passing tests, six failed tests,
2,640 skipped tests and 43 failed files. Four cases fail before assertions during
database bootstrap; other files fail setup or cleanup. Two separate cases time
out at 15 seconds and 300 seconds. After host recovery both passed unchanged
in isolation (documentation read and streamed Git snapshot); the original
full run remains failed and the exact timeout causes remain unproven. This is not a green
repository test run. All Runner verification stages pass across retained,
targeted retries, including 2,533 base TypeScript tests, Rust, 22 SDK tests,
537 scenario tests, 25 main browser tests, six SDK browser tests, 43 scenario
browser tests, 112 issue-thread browser tests, import/package gates and an actual
clean-consumer pack/install. The aggregate `verify` command was not rerun from
the beginning after those repairs. The
[validation checkpoint](runner-rich-acp-validation-2026-09-29.json) retains source
revisions, log hashes, failed attempts and the exact scope of each pass.
The shared PR includes test setup/settlement repairs, corrected baseline browser
expectations, the standalone devtool loader repair and verification-script fixes.
The private embedded Postgres package required its declared postinstall to
restore shipped dylib symlinks before live startup; a credential-free server
health check and subsequent paid question passed with the repair hashed in
their evidence. A green full-suite run and final-head CI remain required.

The Copilot attempt increased the visible included-credit counter from 5 to 6;
additional usage remained disabled at a $0 budget. Per-run USD is unknown.
The first two Pi attempts failed before inference and have zero exclusive-key
billing delta in delayed observations. Pi hello attempt 03 passed on the combined
`97217c531` runtime: 15,340 input, 332 output and 15,360 cached tokens, with a
delayed exclusive-key delta of $0.00065884. The native USD receipt remains
unpriced. All 48 observed owned process identities were retired. Its retained
invocation policy allowed one automatic retry even though the supervisor declared
zero; exactly one Product attempt ran. This configuration gap is retained in
evidence, and subsequent supervisors explicitly pass `--max-automatic-retries 0`.
The current-profile Copilot v4 attempt on `807feaecf` increased included usage
from 6 to 7 credits, with additional usage still disabled; it failed after answer
submission because run attachment rejected the refreshed registered file root.
All 59 owned processes retired. Pi v7 hello on the same source passed with the
$0.000646464 delayed delta above and explicit zero retries. Its informational
pricing-estimate notice appears with a generic warning icon; that presentation
needs refinement and is not a provider error. Failed attempts, missing cost
coverage and cleanup remain recorded. The $100
shared budget and provider allocations remain in force; one successful hello
does not establish production qualification.

The corrected Copilot question on `bd4cc29c3` passed all six matchers with two
runs on the same provider session, no invariant failures and all 59 observed
owned processes retired. Its included-credit counter moved from 7 to 8; the
subsequent four-case campaign moved from 8 to 11. That campaign passed hello,
plan approval and question continuation after controller restart, then stopped
at file-edit startup timeout. No automatic retries occurred. All campaign
processes retired and post-run runtime/dependency checks passed. Additional
GitHub usage remained disabled at $0/$0; these account counters do not supply a
native per-run dollar receipt. The plan and question journeys use authenticated
Paperclip semantic tools; they do not establish a native Copilot ask-user
responder.

Pi Daytona attempt 01 used the previous `807feaecf` image and never reached
provider inference. Exclusive OpenRouter usage stayed unchanged. The owned
sandbox’s closed usage interval cost $0.000407164 in delayed sandbox-specific
analytics, and the resource was observed absent throughout the cleanup window.
The failed attempt and launcher teardown diagnostic are retained. The next
image is built from `bd4cc29c3`, with digest
`sha256:bff4c3f291087a0eeae37e4c20dd51857b92833eaf73ba3aca4157f37de1e109`.
Its installed Linux provider-pack digest is
`sha256:08ad9f6a6fb9c14c87e3bc5b20d01876986178c768433d709a45540e8d40a4be`.
An image build and manifest check are not paid remote qualification.

The [sanitized qualification checkpoint](runner-rich-acp-qualification-2026-09-29.json)
retains current attempts and their original source/profile identities. Pi's
corrected `bd4cc29c3` Daytona hello passed six matchers with one run; the sandbox
was absent throughout the full cleanup window and all owned processes retired.
Three delayed reads stabilized at $0.000630644 OpenRouter usage plus $0.0046878842
sandbox analytics ($0.0053185282 combined, provisional provider accounting).

Host semaphore exhaustion was confirmed by a credential-free PostgreSQL
bootstrap reproduction (`semget` returned `ENOSPC`). With the user's approval,
a fixed-snapshot cleanup removed 4,892 stale sets (83,164 semaphores) and skipped
11 whose recorded creator PID was present. Startup and graceful shutdown now
pass. Private qualification supervisors were also repaired to let the owned
server shut down PostgreSQL before terminating launcher wrappers. Paid Cursor
hello and Copilot file runs each returned to the 255-set baseline without a
forced PostgreSQL kill; no provider runtime bytes changed.

Cursor hello attempt 01 stopped in the private supervisor before provider
launch. A process-inspection race was reproduced and repaired; attempt 02 passed
six matchers with one run. Its matching account usage row is labeled Free (24K
tokens), while native token and dollar receipts remain unavailable. Copilot's
new file diagnostic passed seven matchers, exact file bytes and validation in
one run; its included-credit counter moved from 11 to 12 with additional usage
disabled. An initial workspace-only citation was rejected, then the model
registered its deliverable and completed in the same run. This is not a retry.

Earlier Copilot local and first Daytona failures remain preserved. The remote
invocation never reached fixture creation or a cloud-write path; its machine
cleanup flag remains `unresolved_scope_not_captured`, separately from that
source-order assessment. Host exhaustion does not explain the earlier provider
session timeout. The Pi local/native campaign stopped at its second cell: hello passed, and all
15 native-question behavioral checks passed, but a required API snapshot was
missing. The failed Product result remains retained; the six later cells did
not launch. A minimal harness-only snapshot repair and seven focused regressions
are committed. The two calls cost $0.004005496 by delayed exclusive-key delta.
Cursor’s subsequent question-resume test also stopped its batch on a provider
reopen failure; all 56 owned processes exited and semaphore counts returned to
baseline. Its matching account row is Free (24.7K tokens). A credential-free reproduction shows that a fresh ACPX manager can return a
saved Cursor record without loading the native provider. The committed repair
forces an exact-model control to load that session and acknowledge current
instructions within the existing admission deadline, then renews the consumed
launch lease. Missing or incorrect acknowledgements still block prompting.
The original private sidecar stack is unavailable; this is corroborating
reproduction evidence. The fix passed 93 focused tests and package typecheck;
the rebuilt `627451ecf` runtime subsequently passed question continuation,
semantic plan approval and question continuation after controller restart. Its
file test created and validated exact bytes and reached Done, but the model added
`VALIDATION` to the explicitly requested final marker, failing two of seven
matchers. The batch retains that failure: four cells, seven runs, 23/25 matchers.
All owned processes retired. Seven matching account rows were explicitly Free
and on-demand usage remained zero; native per-run dollars are still unavailable.
Later cases from the original failed batch were not launched.

Copilot Daytona hello attempt 02 passed six matchers with one run. All 45 owned
processes retired and the exact owned sandbox remained absent throughout the
360-second cleanup observation. Three delayed sandbox analytics reads stabilized
at $0.0039682144; this remains provisional infrastructure accounting, separate
from unavailable native per-run dollars and the account’s unchanged included-credit
counter. Additional Copilot usage remains disabled.

Pi’s native-question retry on unchanged `bd4cc29c3` runtime and separate
`43c99f044` eval source passed 15/15 with complete required evidence. The next
question continuation reached Done with two succeeded runs, but failed one of
six matchers because the final item included earlier pre-tool narration. Retained
post-tool text deltas alone match the expected final marker. Both cells fully
settled, all 96 owned process identities retired across the two cells, and delayed
exclusive-key charges totaled $0.005707808. Five later cells did not launch;
the final-message defect remains under investigation.

GitHub billing coverage was also audited: public standard-runner and self-hosted
GitHub minute charges do not add a per-minute charge, but external fleet costs
and private evals CI incremental charges remain unmetered. The $100 live-test
ceiling is not evidence of complete infrastructure cost attribution.

## Registered persistent agent files

Candidate ACP processes receive `AGENT_HOME` only from the authenticated
runtime context's server-registered `agent_files` working copy. Ambient
environment values cannot grant a directory. Admission rejects symlink roots,
filesystem roots and overlap with provider runtime state; directory identity is
rechecked at launch and before each turn. Each provider reopen receives the
current run's registered copy. The native executor requires provider shutdown
before collecting and synchronizing the copy. Pi additionally receives a
runner-owned native-tool root binding; its task read-only policy still applies.
These checks do not by themselves qualify provider-specific native file tools.

The provider branches were implemented in parallel from the foundation. Final
shared registration and packaging conflicts are resolved in dependency order:
foundation → Cursor → Copilot → shared input/continuation prerequisite → Pi.
They remain separate managed worktrees and PR review units; the later PR bases include their prerequisite providers. Foundation
acceptance completed with Apex 5/5 and passing CI; that result does not cover
subsequent provider changes. Provider PRs remain unmerged
pending qualification. Source reports on the provider branches are
`doc/architecture/runner-cursor-capabilities.md`,
`doc/architecture/runner-copilot-capabilities.md`, and
`doc/architecture/runner-pi-capabilities.md`. Those reports retain versioned
source references, per-field dispositions, fixture paths, and narrower claims.
The Copilot inventory enumerates all 150 pinned native event types. Read the

for the complete per-provider source audit.

[Retained browser evidence](../../ui/storybook/fixtures/evidence/rich-acp-browser-proof.darwin-arm64.json)
records the production renderer's full native plan, accept/reject/cancel,
single/multiple selection, typed input and activity-details checks. Its Cursor
transport is a canonical fixture, not a paid provider session. The browser
renders a 99,724-character plan and verifies its final paragraph before approval.
The JSON records screenshot hashes; screenshots remain outside the source tree.

## Capability matrix

“Candidate” means implemented or observed in deterministic tests. It does not
mean the required paid local and Daytona product cases have passed. “Not exposed”
means the pinned interface was inspected; “unverified” is a separate finding.
Codex's row is the existing app-server integration, not the Codex ACP bridge.

The provider reports above are the method/event and field inventories. Paid
observations in the matrix refer to retained historical versions unless an
explicit profile is named; the current checkpoint above controls qualification. In the
table below, a method that is absent from a pinned implementation is distinct
from an exposed method with no Paperclip control. Shared surfaces and their
deterministic evidence are mapped separately after the comparison.

| Capability | Codex app-server benchmark | Cursor ACP candidate | Copilot ACP candidate | Pi ACP candidate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Exact model | Selected and reported model | Explicit ID required; exact echo, paid semantic protocol and five local semantic product cases passed | Explicit ID required; exact `gpt-5.6-luna` echo, paid semantic protocol and local completion/file/plan/restart passed | Exact `openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731`, native-verified `low`; profile-13 paid hello, semantic continuation, native questions and human denial pass; file/restart/warm failures remain open |
| Text and tools | Typed thread/turn/item events | Standard ACP updates; child activity kept separate | Standard ACP plus opt-in native session events | Wrapper text/tool updates and owned tool gates |
| Active steering | Dedicated `turn/steer` | Concurrent prompt replaces/cancels, so it is not steering | Concurrent prompt replaces/cancels, so it is not steering | Owned `pi/steer` requires handshake, exact active turn and acknowledgment; historical probe passed, profile-13 paid proof pending |
| Queued follow-up | Product continuation controls | Controller can schedule a later prompt; native queue not established | Native pending-message activity exists; no qualified ACP queue responder | Owned `pi/follow_up`, separately named and ordered; historical marker-order proof, profile-13 paid proof pending |
| Cancellation | Typed interrupt and process lifecycle | ACP cancel; paid command cleanup pending | ACP cancel; attached async native settlement passes offline. Explicit detached work is rejected before side effects; it is not supported background settlement | Native abort; wrapper waits for `agent_settled` and treats provider errors as failure |
| Session continuity | Read/load/history/fork and durable identity | Session load/list observed; paid semantic warm continuation passed; native history replay unverified and fork absent in tested methods | Session load plus native history events; semantic pending-question controller recovery passed | Private Pi JSONL mapping/load; native RPC `fork`, `clone`, `get_fork_messages` are not mapped through this ACP wrapper; unresolved UI promises cannot survive provider death |
| Questions | Typed input requests and response correlation | `cursor/ask_question`, option identity and multiple selection preserved | Native ask-user capability exists, but pinned ACP does not wire its responder; do not display a false answerable form | `select`, `confirm`, `input`, `editor` through typed form elicitation |
| Permissions | Durable typed approvals | Standard ACP permission options; denied shell write had no observed side effects; separately labeled exact-correlation assessment | Standard ACP; real native reject_once prevented marker creation; session decision scope inspected | Native pre-tool gate; allow once, exact-operation session grant, deny; paths rechecked after wait |
| Plans | Typed plan and collaboration mode | `cursor/create_plan` includes full plan and revision-bound accept/reject/cancel; todo activity separate | Native plan events displayed; native plan-decision callback not exposed in ACP | No native structured plan event; authenticated Paperclip planning tools available |
| Authenticated tools | Runner bridge and governed operations | ACP HTTP MCP binding; paid context/history reads passed | ACP HTTP MCP binding; paid context read passed | Owned extension registers exact bound MCP tools; profile-13 paid Product completion/questions and seeded Runner context pass; no ambient servers |
| Delegation | Typed agent roles and lifecycle | Opt-in subagent lifecycle, nested ownership and bounded child activity; never parent transcript flattening | Native session details retain agent/model fields with unknown originating turn; typed turn-owned delegation is not inferred | No built-in ACP delegation protocol; arbitrary extensions are excluded |
| Files/diffs | Typed file changes and artifact references | Standard tool changes plus validated image references | Correlated ACP tool events remain available; native session file/workspace details are session notices, not attributed task file changes | Wrapper-retained read/write/edit diffs; common typed/UI projection remains partial; semantic artifact tools |
| Images/artifacts | Typed references and registered work products | Existing contained files only, provenance, `registered:false` | Native session artifact details are bounded notices with no inferred turn ownership or automatic registration | Image/resource tool blocks preserved by wrapper; dedicated artifact channel absent |
| Image/attachment input | Typed input conversion | ACP advertises images, but the runner turn converter currently forwards text only | ACP advertises images/embedded context, but the runner turn converter currently forwards text only | Native Pi/ACP image input exists, but the runner turn converter currently forwards text only |
| Usage | Per-request receipt and model context | Pinned ACP omitted receipts on denied and successful turns; account UI confirms included usage separately | ACP/native tokens retained; account UI confirms included credits separately, without a per-run USD receipt | Assistant-message and compaction token receipts; dollar cost is a catalog pricing estimate, never authoritative billing |
| Config/model changes | Typed configurable controls | Agent/Plan/Ask setup is bound to native configuration acknowledgements and recovery; unsolicited mode drift fails admission. Rich parameterized model picker remains unused | Model/reasoning/mode options exist; runtime policy remains authoritative | Exact model; native available levels and set/get-state confirmation map through ACP mode/config to typed `piThinkingLevel`, recovery identity and UI setup. Active-turn mode changes and arbitrary slash commands/extensions remain disabled |
| Reconnect/restart | Durable controller replay and qualified provider restoration | Semantic pending question survived a real controller restart; exact native callback restoration remains unverified | Semantic pending question survived controller restart with the same interaction and provider session; native callback restoration remains unverified | Wrapper explicitly advertises live-process-only pending-input recovery |

| Shared capability | User-visible surface | Inspectable implementation / deterministic evidence |

| Session list/fork, generic configuration and commands | No added operator surface; exact owned session recovery and configured model remain available | Provider inventories identify native-only, ACP-exposed, confirmed-absent and unverified methods with follow-ups |

Paths starting with `src/` or `runner/` in this evidence table are relative to
`packages/paperclip-runner/`; other paths are repository-relative. Deterministic
fixtures establish contract behavior, not successful paid provider execution.

## Shared event and interaction contract

The active connection, wire session, normalized turn and original request identity
bind every extension callback. The allowlist is per provider. An omitted wire
session can only acquire the verified active connection's session; an explicit
mismatch is rejected. Retired streams and inactive turns cannot emit new activity.

Requests enter durable runtime state before the UI presents them. The response
must match an outstanding request and an offered action or valid typed answer.
The direct driver and sidecar await a receipt for the exact JSON-RPC pipe write before the runtime settles its durable record.
The successful resolution enters the retained event outbox in the same atomic
state save that removes the pending request. A restart before journal delivery
retains that resolution for normal event replay and acknowledgment. A restart
before this state save instead expires the unresolved request; neither path sends
the provider response again.
If persistence fails, the current executor stops accepting commands and exposing
or acknowledging retained events. Cleanup still terminates its owned provider,
but leaves the uncertain snapshot untouched. A fresh executor reads the complete
atomic snapshot that survived; it cannot publish an in-memory resolution that
conflicts with a later recovery expiry.
Standard ACP does not acknowledge application of a permission reply; a lost
transport acknowledgment is not proof of exactly-once external effects. A
replacement provider process cannot inherit an old approval promise. A bounded durable ledger expires pending requests after provider loss or unsafe restart, including requests whose creation events were already acknowledged. No tool
mutation or approval is automatically replayed into a replacement.

Full plan documents have a bounded 100,000-character description and a 196 KiB
question-set envelope. Oversized plans fail rather than approve an unseen suffix.
Display redaction remains visible. Decision descriptions render image references as
inert text and Mermaid diagrams as source, so reviewing a plan does not fetch
provider-selected media. Automatic issue-reference linking is disabled for these
descriptions, so a long provider plan cannot start an issue-detail query for every
identifier. The rich event channel has exact canonical
schemas and a bounded envelope. It cannot create terminal outcomes, dispatch a
semantic tool, register an artifact, synchronize a durable plan, or supply source
authority. Notices retain useful bounded fields and provenance in expandable UI
details. Provider references remain unregistered until a control-plane operation
registers them.

Permission labels are derived from offered option kinds. An unknown or duplicate
option is rejected. A provider's “always” decision is not relabeled “this session”
unless the pinned implementation proves that scope. Restrictive execution policy
is separate from automatic approval and company governance. Fresh permission
configuration defaults to full auto; it never overrides read-only task policy.

## Distribution and isolation

Cursor pins `2026.09.26-dd393fe`; Copilot pins `1.0.88`; Pi pins wrapper `0.0.33`,
runtime `1.0.0` (Pi profile v13), portable Node and its full npm lock. Native distribution hashes
cover macOS ARM64, macOS x64 and Linux x64. Source-owned closure pins remain
separate from profile declaration digests. Native admission reads held files,
verifies every admitted byte, creates a private immutable snapshot and retains
the existing process guardian. A manifest cannot supply its own trusted pin.

Candidate credentials are only read from explicitly bound run environments:
Cursor `CURSOR_API_KEY`/`CURSOR_AUTH_TOKEN`, Copilot `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, Pi
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. Ambient GitHub login variables, provider configuration,
extensions and MCP discovery do not establish authority. Homes/config/cache are
private. Updates are disabled. Pi launches only its owned extension and assigned
skills, with a startup sentinel before a prompt can run.

Build candidate packs explicitly with `--candidate-providers=<name>` on that
provider's branch. Local and remote pack verification includes the complete
candidate asset tree. The corresponding Daytona build argument is documented in
`docker/daytona-runner/README.md`. Candidate packaging never promotes a profile.

ACP is not an OS sandbox. Cursor v3 patches the verified native ACP
distribution to disable project and ambient MCP discovery and local/remote
hooks. Offline poison-configuration tests exercise the actual transformed
vendor functions; paid and remote qualification remain required. Pi's tool policy supplements the execution boundary; arbitrary
shell commands and filesystem races require the host boundary. These are
qualification gates, not claims that a JavaScript path check confines a shell.

## Historical gaps and follow-ups — October 2, 2026

| Priority | Exposed but unused, partial, or unverified | Reason and next proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Remaining paid product cases on local and Daytona | Current Cursor10/Copilot13/Pi13 require authenticated local and Daytona evidence on the exact current runtime. The current Pi checkpoint above supersedes older profile coverage. Historical Cursor4 passed hello/question/plan/restart but its latest file marker failed despite correct bytes. Copilot4 passed all five basic local journeys and Daytona hello. Pi7 passed native questions but continuation exposed the final-message bug repaired in8. The semaphore blocker is resolved and Cursor's approved on-demand cap is $25. Native interaction, denial, settlement, platform and complete cost/cleanup gates remain open; no old profile pass qualifies new bytes. |
| P0 | Pi profile-13 Product and platform verification | Four paid local cases and one seeded Runner case pass. File validation, pending-input restart and warm continuation remain failed; assertion repairs do not regrade them. Finish the remaining local, Runner/native-control, Intel startup and Linux/Daytona cases on fresh final builds. Earlier semaphore and v6 startup faults remain historical evidence; never remove unrelated IPC objects. |
| P0 | Copilot native ask-user and plan-decision callbacks | Pinned ACP does not install native responders. Prove no blocking request is exposed, or add a qualified responder/wrapper; never swallow the request. |
| P0 | Broader Copilot denial and background settlement qualification | Pinned 1.0.88 and isolated 1.0.89 settle attached async commands, but deliberately detached work can finish after end_turn. The earlier paid detached success depended on that model waiting and is not general settlement evidence. Profiles v3/v4 reject explicit detached admission before effects; governed long-lived background work remains unsupported. Denial and process-death recovery pass offline; paid local/Daytona proof remains required. |
| P0 | Cursor native question availability | Explicit Luna and Composer native-only Plan-mode probes admitted the selected model and trusted instructions but emitted no question callback. The vendor-patch reversal and actual MCP-context constructor proof identify no local native-tool removal. Effective native tool selection is beyond the remote AgentService boundary; seek upstream catalog/availability evidence. No further blind model grid or semantic-question substitution qualifies this feature. |
| P0 | Typed Cursor entitlement failure | The v4 native patch preserves typed entitlement/authentication errors. Offline transformed-vendor tests and clean native authentication failure probes pass. The historical first-account failure remains retained; authenticated Product proof on the revised runtime is still required. |
| P0 | Cursor project and remote hooks; native shell boundaries | The verified v4 patch disables native ambient MCP/hooks at their actual initialization points on all three platforms. Retain real paid/remote isolation and command cleanup qualification before promotion. |
| P1 | Native Pi queue selection in the product UI | The runner API exposes negotiated `follow_up` separately from active steering. The current composer has no native queue selector; add one without confusing it with controller-scheduled later turns. |
| P1 | Pi `queue_update` contents and delivery state | RPC acknowledgment proves acceptance, not model consumption. Add bounded queued/delivered events and durable message correlation with explicit retention rules for user content; preserve this distinction on reconnect. The selected live marker-order probe proves its own consumed messages only. |
| P1 | Pi retry/compaction field completeness and end-to-end evidence | The wrapper now emits bounded `paperclip/pi_notice` activity instead of assistant text. The adapter preserves source provenance, retry counters/delay, outcome flags and bounded reason/error text; package tests cover retry success/failure/unknown and compaction usage. `finalError` is not forwarded, and summarization retry currently has summary-only data. Extend field-by-field wrapper/canonical/UI coverage; these deterministic checks do not qualify live behavior or give notices terminal authority. |
| P1 | Native Cursor/Copilot active steering and queues | ACP prompt replacement is not steering; native SDK capabilities may be richer. Require a dedicated bound method plus acknowledgment before advertising. |
| P1 | Child tool media/diff/raw payloads | Bounded delegation summaries preserve lifecycle and identity. Large nested payloads need a child-owned canonical item model; current omission is a visible notice and provider report entry. |
| P1 | Standard ACP parent tool `content` diffs/images, secondary locations and raw input bodies | The existing common normalizer projects bounded output text, input-presence, and the first safe relative location. Raw argument bodies can contain secrets; richer content needs bounded typed blocks and a separately validated workspace binding for each file. Provider-specific image/file notices do not close this standard-tool gap. |
| P1 | User attachments and image prompting | `AcpxRuntimeTurnInput` and the common runtime adapter currently forward text only, despite underlying image-input support. Implement validated attachment-to-ACP content conversion and model-specific capability admission, then qualify real local/Daytona image prompts. This is an implementation gap as well as a live-verification gap. |
| P1 | Copilot native session event attribution | `_session_event` omits an originating turn. Preserve bounded event fields as session-scoped notices with `turnAttribution: unknown`; typed delegation, artifacts and compaction need an explicit native correlation contract before turn-owned projection. Standard correlated ACP events remain separate. |
| P1 | Copilot session-store files and export/artifact URIs | Provider paths are not task-workspace paths. Add a separately authorized export flow with validated bytes and provenance; do not resolve arbitrary URLs or auto-register. |
| P1 | Pi native fork/history/export interfaces | Pi native RPC exposes `fork(entryId)`, `clone`, `get_fork_messages` and `export_html`; these remain available in the pinned 1.0.0 release. The wrapper does not map them to runner controls. Add durable branch lineage for fork/clone and an authorized, contained artifact flow for HTML export before exposing them; do not label these native capabilities absent. |
| P1 | Complete usage/billing provenance | Missing cache fields remain unknown. Pi price estimates are displayed separately. Budget qualification requires actual spend coverage, not an estimate presented as a bill. |
| P1 | Fork/history and richer configuration controls | Cursor session mode now has explicit admission-bound setup. Arbitrary session discovery/forking, mid-turn configuration changes and the parameterized model picker still need company-scoped controls and durable lineage. |
| P1 | Exact pending-request restoration after process death | Session transcript restoration does not restore callbacks. Expire unresolved requests unless a provider proves exact restoration. |
| P1 | Paid qualification of persistent agent-directory access | Candidate launch paths now bind only the registered `agent_files` working copy, and Pi's native-tool policy admits that root while preserving read-only restrictions. Cold restoration refreshes both the trusted context and composed instructions. Environment delivery alone does not prove model awareness: Cursor and Copilot ignore generic ACP `_meta.systemPrompt`. Provider-specific instruction delivery must pass fresh/load model-boundary checks, followed by paid local/Daytona persistence and cleanup-before-collection cases. Ambient roots remain excluded. |
| P2 | Remaining Copilot native diagnostic/config/account events | The provider inventory records every event and field, its projection or reason for omission. Preserve bounded useful context; avoid credentials, raw environment or unbounded blobs. |
| P2 | Pi empty or whitespace-only submitted input/editor text | Canonical required text rejects blank responses; optional blank responses are omitted. Defaults can be empty and nonblank text preserves boundary whitespace. Add explicit empty-text semantics across TypeScript, Rust and UI before claiming complete native empty-answer parity. |
| P2 | Pi native extension surfaces and unsupported slash commands | Arbitrary extensions/templates/themes may execute ambient code. Only reviewed runner-owned capabilities are admitted; structured native plan/goals are not fabricated. Native fork/clone/export are separate unmapped capabilities above. |
| P2 | Pi status/widget/title/editor and session/configuration notifications | `setStatus`, `setWidget`, `setTitle` and `set_editor_text` have no UI projection and are unused by the owned extension. Native session-name and thinking-level notifications also lack a dedicated projection, although selected thinking level is now handled through ACP mode/config and native confirmation. Provider notice summary/severity has deterministic UI coverage, with rebuilt paid visual proof pending. Add bounded schemas for the remaining fields; `notify` and interactive input already have separate bridges. |
| P2 | Pi invocation and history provenance metadata | The v4 wrapper retains `nativeToolCallId`, `modelIteration`, `historyMessageIndex` and `identityScope` in private ACP-wire metadata. Closed common tool and permission projections omit them from the UI. Normalized IDs still correlate live tool, MCP and permission events. Add bounded, redacted display-only provenance fields and parity tests before surfacing the native metadata. |
| P2 | Conditional native-plan follow-up fields | Cursor's optional rejection-reason field also appears for accept/cancel. The current question renderer has no conditional fields; add conditional presentation without changing the revision-bound decision receipt. |
| P2 | Cursor command exit code projection | The paid file case preserved native `exitCode: 0` inside output text, while the canonical command field remained null. Normalize a typed, correlated exit code without parsing arbitrary prose; current independent file assertions do not prove this field. |

### Capability-gap classification at source `41503eb38`

This source review separates future implementation work from qualification of
already implemented behavior. It adds no paid proof and does not replace the
provider inventories or historical receipts. References below bind exact source
`41503eb38f03c436b1569f9f0204625bb4d58782`; a native advertisement or retained wire field
does not establish Runner projection or a usable product control.

| Priority / category | Meaningful gap and reason | Follow-up and source boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 / qualification | Native decisions, denial, attached-command settlement and callback recovery still need the required current-profile cases. Semantic question/plan/restart evidence is a different path. | Complete the existing local/Daytona cases and retain failed attempts; no new feature is implied by this row. The [capability matrix](#capability-matrix) and versioned qualification receipts govern claims. |
| P1 / Runner input | Native image input is available on the inspected surfaces, but Runner turns forward text only. | Add bounded, validated attachment conversion and exact-model admission, then qualify actual image prompts. [`AcpxRuntimeTurnInput`](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/blob/41503eb38f03c436b1569f9f0204625bb4d58782/packages/paperclip-runner/src/drivers/acpx/runtime-host.ts#L111), [text forwarding](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/blob/41503eb38f03c436b1569f9f0204625bb4d58782/packages/paperclip-runner/src/drivers/acpx/codex-runtime-adapter.ts#L1404). |
| P1 / Runner output and UI | Structured tool diffs/media, raw arguments and secondary locations are not carried into canonical tool details; exit code remains null, including where Pi retains a structured native result. | Add typed, redacted fields and workspace validation with local/sidecar/UI parity tests. File-byte or artifact-card checks do not prove rich diff or exit-code presentation. [Common mapper](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/blob/41503eb38f03c436b1569f9f0204625bb4d58782/packages/paperclip-runner/src/provider-events.ts#L1131), [sidecar boundary](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/blob/41503eb38f03c436b1569f9f0204625bb4d58782/packages/paperclip-runner/src/cli/acpx-runtime-sidecar.ts#L917), [Pi result fixture](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/blob/41503eb38f03c436b1569f9f0204625bb4d58782/packages/paperclip-runner/test/pi-acp-package-contract.test.mjs#L279). |
| P1 / native queue and UI | Pi exposes distinct `follow_up`, but native queue contents/consumption are not durably projected and the product queue has no native follow-up selector. Acknowledgment is acceptance, not consumption. | Add negotiated selection and occurrence-bound queued/consumed/dropped evidence with retention rules; keep controller scheduling distinct. [Control contract](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/blob/41503eb38f03c436b1569f9f0204625bb4d58782/packages/paperclip-runner/src/drivers/acpx/turn-controls.ts#L1), [current UI actions](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/blob/41503eb38f03c436b1569f9f0204625bb4d58782/ui/src/components/task-chat/TaskChatQueuedMessages.tsx#L39). |
| P1 / child and session attribution | Cursor child tools have attributed summaries, not nested rich details. Copilot native notices lack originating-turn identity and therefore remain session-scoped; provider-session files/assets still require retrieval and registration. | Add a child-owned detail model; require a native origin contract before assigning Copilot notices to turns, and separately authorize artifact retrieval. [Cursor summary boundary](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/blob/41503eb38f03c436b1569f9f0204625bb4d58782/packages/paperclip-runner/src/drivers/acpx/cursor-extensions.ts#L401), [Copilot provenance boundary](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/blob/41503eb38f03c436b1569f9f0204625bb4d58782/packages/paperclip-runner/src/drivers/acpx/copilot-extension-adapter.ts#L19). |
| P1 / accounting qualification | Token/compaction receipts, catalog price estimates and actual account billing have different authority; missing usage/cost fields remain unknown. | Preserve partial coverage and verify campaign totals against actual spend evidence. Never promote an estimate or model multiplier into a bill. [Usage distinctions](#capability-matrix) and the provider inventories remain authoritative. |
| P2 / optional discovery and controls | Commands, configuration/title updates and plan priority lack complete product projection. Pi native fork/export first require wrapper mapping; extension widgets and private invocation provenance are separate optional surfaces. | Add company-scoped controls and bounded fields only where useful, preserving acknowledgments and lineage. These are future features, not new qualification blockers. [Explicitly skipped status tags](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/blob/41503eb38f03c436b1569f9f0204625bb4d58782/packages/paperclip-runner/src/provider-events.ts#L1195), [plan projection](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/blob/41503eb38f03c436b1569f9f0204625bb4d58782/packages/paperclip-runner/src/provider-events.ts#L1097), [Pi remaining work](runner-pi-capabilities.md#remaining-event-and-qualification-work). |

Pi retry/compaction notices are already surfaced as bounded activity. Remaining
field completeness and renderer parity are narrower follow-ups, not an entirely
missing notice implementation. Conversely, a missing paid callback does not
establish that a provider lacks the underlying capability.

## Qualification ledger

Combined ceiling: **$100**, including retries and infrastructure. Cursor allocation:
$25; Copilot: $25; Pi: $25; coordinated diagnosis reserve: $25.
Initial reservations are $2 per provider. Measured cumulative OpenRouter key-usage
delta through Pi's native denial, both file attempts, question, three plan attempts and native controls: **$0.028858372**, including failures.
The first model-backed Pi attempt cost **$0.005748807**. Cursor's first account was
not entitled; its dashboard was unchanged at the displayed precision, with no
per-request receipt. Copilot's first session-start failure left its dashboard at
0/1,500 included AI credits and $0 incremental charges. After its protocol and
Product question cases, GitHub displayed 3/1,500 included credits with additional
usage disabled and a $0 budget. It still displayed 3 immediately after the native
denial and detached-command probes, then 5 after the two-turn plan batch. These
are delayed aggregate snapshots; exact allocation among calls is unverified.
After its denial probe, the selected Cursor account displayed 482.5K included
tokens across twelve qualification requests and zero on-demand tokens. The restart
rows showed 23.8K and 41.7K included tokens; denial used 24.4K. Displayed credit precision
and delayed accounting do not establish
a per-run zero receipt. These measurements are
partial, not a final all-provider total. At that historical ledger checkpoint, no Daytona leases had been started; subsequent Daytona attempts are recorded above.
Registry downloads, fake-model fixtures and metadata-only authenticated discovery
are separate from model inference.

The first Pi canonical `get-task-context` attempt used source `788105248a3ba594b30b5bcec3fa266d8a51d8d4`
and provider-pack digest `sha256:4de47c31a8131424495366741bd491ff5fa10723ab9a3918c07a3e42982dbe3c`.
It observed successful `get_task_context`, `get_task_history`, `list_documents`
and `read_document` calls, then hit its 120-second turn deadline without a
terminal receipt. This is a retained failed attempt, not semantic qualification.
Earlier launch/interpreter failures are retained separately. The initial Cursor
failure exposed a native wrapper gap: a typed entitlement error becomes an
ordinary message and normal completion. The runner does not infer authorization
from that message or fabricate a zero-cost usage receipt.

The selected paid Cursor account passed canonical `get-task-context` at source
`01959b8a602683f13706807983f02c3cba9d36a0`, pack
`sha256:f0b622e9151c1c0886e6220c48ea71993b65887baa88b1600b27462074748ddb`,
using exact `gpt-5.6-luna[context=272k,reasoning=medium,fast=false]`.
Its context/history reads and all four semantic checks passed in 29.291 seconds.
The account usage row attributes 56K tokens to this run, included in its existing
Pro+ subscription; incremental cash is zero. ACP supplied no token or USD receipt.
A conservative list-price bound of $0.07 is an estimate, not an invoice.

Copilot's first real completed attempt used source `92fcaf0c`, the same immutable
runnerd SHA-256 `986060810ba7377c6ddd64a5d89e322d0a434e1a9c80400e6d4acf5934bfc421`,
and exact `gpt-5.6-luna`. One context read and all four canonical semantic checks
passed. The original post-run package/provenance failure is retained; offline
scoring recovered the same artifact with zero additional provider calls. Its
24,258 input, 11,781 cached-input and 441 output tokens yield a $0.00326022 catalog
estimate. GitHub still displayed 0/1,500 included credits and additional billing
disabled with a $0 budget after the run. UI delay/rounding leaves the exact credit
delta unverified; this is not a provider USD receipt. Neither protocol case proves
Product E2E, restrictive permissions, restart recovery, or Daytona qualification.

Separate paid Product E2E evidence now records:

| Provider / local case | Exact source revision | Observed result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cursor / completion | `edf538e61e712dddb6b4d59045c3dcfd445686c7` | 6/6 assertions; committed finalization, one completion marker, cleanup passed |
| Cursor / file edit and validation | `fe132224c2b30a8d9ce7b46cea38b8760af233fc` | 7/7 assertions; independent final file bytes, visible downloadable workspace artifact, cleanup passed |
| Copilot / completion | `bcc9c638a25b91b84065f12633f083bd4f7a689f` | 6/6 assertions and cleanup passed; original accounting projection failed independently |
| Cursor / question continuation | `a7e01a0cec397dd5048f5d5b5825658dc6e91450` | UI answer Cobalt, continuation and 6/6 terminal assertions passed; two expected provider runs, no retry |
| Cursor / semantic plan approval | `a7e01a0cec397dd5048f5d5b5825658dc6e91450` | Displayed plan revision matched the confirmation target; accept/continue and 6/6 terminal assertions passed |
| Copilot / file edit and validation | `ee9536001fbe733b2386dd3379730a4e0be59488` | 7/7 assertions and cleanup passed; independent bytes validated; GitHub biller and unpriced receipt verified |
| Copilot / question continuation | `ee9536001fbe733b2386dd3379730a4e0be59488` | Question/answer and warm session reuse worked; 4/6 terminal assertions passed because the provider returned a literal placeholder instead of the required marker; failed attempt retained |
| Cursor / controller restart | `d35b83074a018537f5475568d7410e3b1d676789` | 6/6 assertions in 57.865 seconds; pending semantic question survived server restart, Cobalt answer continued to Done, cleanup passed; earlier failed attempts retained |
| Pi / completion | `dd78df1ef8b279c30c710c9b7a7f9fda22e321d6` | 6/6 assertions and cleanup passed in 32.668 seconds; one authenticated `paperclip_finish`, `turn.completed` and `run.terminal`; exclusive-key delta $0.000654767 |
| Copilot / semantic plan approval | `c06fc5fccc88f5816450434493451b9d2d339125` | 6/6 assertions in 45.625 seconds; accepted decision bound to displayed revision 1, exact marker and Done; both paused/completed receipts are GitHub/unpriced; cleanup passed |
| Copilot / controller restart | `19ca0f558` (final runtime remains `8aa867b64d5fc2fd62cff110bd000addf5dc54de`) | 6/6 assertions in 50.875 seconds; same pending interaction survived restart and same persisted provider session continued; exact marker once, Done and cleanup passed |
| Pi / file edit and validation | Runtime `dd78df1ef8b279c30c710c9b7a7f9fda22e321d6` | Failed at the 120-second active deadline after five rejected `paperclip_finish` calls; cleanup passed. The extension discarded validation details. Final bytes and completion arguments cannot be reconstructed from the retained projection. |
| Pi / file edit and validation, v3 | Pack source `7710736ca3924c655c5b0efd172cfd3c0173766a`; execution fix `06cf356a8bc94f709fcd15606fe05e17933fe3b2` | 7/7 assertions in 49.427 seconds, exact file bytes and cleanup passed. One rejected completion exposed the missing registered deliverable; Pi corrected it, registered the artifact and finished. Exclusive-key delta $0.003324737. |
| Pi / semantic question, v3 | Pack source `7710736ca3924c655c5b0efd172cfd3c0173766a` | 6/6 assertions in 158.388 seconds across two bounded turns; exact question/option IDs, Cobalt answer, warm continuation, final marker and cleanup passed. First waiting run has no usage receipt; exclusive-key delta covers both runs ($0.001413697). |
| Pi / semantic plan, v3 first attempt | Pack source `7710736ca3924c655c5b0efd172cfd3c0173766a` | Failed the native write-boundary UI assertion in 119.553 seconds. The saved two-step plan, matching revision and confirmation controls were visible, but all retained DOM snapshots showed the fallback Plan card. Rust lost the MCP display name/namespace used for placement. Cleanup passed; exclusive-key delta $0.003090504. Matcher remains unchanged. |
| Pi / semantic plan, v3 second attempt | Combined pack source `7ab463697037c9456a4ad2b83ea0e9c28b353f8a`; daemon source `e35b11db21b8da8527fa0b6c6f5fe186bdced111` | Displayed Plan placement and revision-bound acceptance passed. The resumed turn exceeded the unchanged 120-second active deadline; total case duration 260.246 seconds, cleanup passed. Pi reused native `call_0` for different tool executions, so the bridge correctly rejected conflicting identities. No terminal usage receipt; exclusive-key delta $0.002440082. |
| Pi / semantic plan, v4 first attempt | Frozen combined runtime `f556110d588a9de9fefe676a9a62bf09e98afb85`; fresh pack `sha256:4df7e9fa164929c7ae7d8e8711f0bf7d587d9fa6a246d0a8340f318f57168855` | Infrastructure failure during embedded PostgreSQL initialization in 6.679 seconds; no provider process or prompt. Disposable reproduction confirms host SysV semaphore exhaustion (16 free, 17 required). Cleanup passed, exclusive-key delta $0, and all original graders/deadlines remain unchanged. |

Pi's immediately preceding `hello05` consumed $0.000351509 and failed evidence
packaging after a confirmed 888-second host Maintenance Sleep. It reached
authenticated prompt acceptance but retained no semantic-tool or terminal event.
An incomplete Playwright archive could not be inspected (`unzip` exit 9), so the
existing scanner failed closed with its `secret_leak` classification; no credential
match was observed. That canonical failure remains unchanged. The deliberate
`hello06` repeat used the same runtime source, a task-owned idle-sleep hold, and
both wall-clock and monotonic outer deadlines. Canonical Pi cost remains unpriced;
the exclusive-key billing delta is separate evidence, not a fabricated receipt.

Separate real native probes used final immutable packs without a Product database:

| Provider / probe | Runtime source | Observed result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cursor / native AskQuestion | `25fb1b5b317e52a8ad50208d7681a1ee34bd939c` | Failed: zero native input events, normal terminal and cleanup; the provider reported that the tool was unavailable. This does not qualify the native question bridge. |
| Copilot / denied write | `8aa867b64d5fc2fd62cff110bd000addf5dc54de` | Passed: actual native permission request ID 0, original `reject_once`, forbidden marker absent in all 79 observations through process cleanup. |
| Copilot / detached command | `8aa867b64d5fc2fd62cff110bd000addf5dc54de` | Passed: actual `mode:async` and `detach:true`, original `allow_once`; command completion at 10.083 seconds and marker at 10.098 preceded `end_turn` at 10.675; five-second late-effect check and process cleanup passed. |
| Pi / denied write | `dd78df1ef8b279c30c710c9b7a7f9fda22e321d6` | Passed in 20.438 seconds: actual native permission ID 0 persisted before original reject_once reply, pipe delivery acknowledged, correlated tool failed, prompt settled end_turn, forbidden file absent and cleanup passed. |
| Cursor / denied shell write | `25fb1b5b317e52a8ad50208d7681a1ee34bd939c` | Original grader failed because permission omitted rawInput. Separate offline assessment passed from the preceding exact-command tool_call bound to the same toolCallId, original reject-once reply and 98 independent absent-file observations through terminal and cleanup; no repeat prompt. |
| Pi / active steering and queued follow-up, v3 | Pack source `7710736ca3924c655c5b0efd172cfd3c0173766a` | Passed in 21.342 seconds. Both active-session operations acknowledged while a persisted native write permission waited; original reject_once denied the tool, visible STEERED_CURRENT preceded QUEUED_NEXT, forbidden file stayed absent, end_turn settled, stale steer was rejected and cleanup passed. |
| Pi / active steering and queued follow-up, v4 | Frozen combined runtime `f556110d588a9de9fefe676a9a62bf09e98afb85`; verified pack `sha256:4df7e9fa164929c7ae7d8e8711f0bf7d587d9fa6a246d0a8340f318f57168855` | Passed in 20.255 seconds: normalized invocation identity matched the denied tool update; both controls acknowledged before the original denial; exact STEERED_CURRENT then QUEUED_NEXT, stale steering rejected, end_turn and cleanup passed, forbidden file absent. Settled exclusive-key delta $0.000546502; separate Pi estimate $0.000803936. |
| Pi / active steering and queued follow-up, v5 | Runtime `aec26ad83f1d082f0d0a5eaffbd615a9e2e26155`; pack `sha256:cf7d0998bbc2bed7b893c726c2b6455ba8a683d9cff7d92afedbff2d5900d500` | Passed in 19.199 seconds: one real normalized write invocation, original reject_once persisted before reply, both controls acknowledged before denial, exact STEERED_CURRENT then QUEUED_NEXT, stale steering rejected, end_turn, forbidden file absent and cleanup passed. Settled exclusive-key delta $0.000151739; its separate Pi estimate is $0.000611156. |

These narrow native probes do not replace durable Product interaction, restart,
or Daytona coverage. Their private wire evidence remains separate from sanitized
public summaries. A private durable retention manifest also records hashes for the
logs, screenshots, wire evidence and failed attempts; no credentials are published. The semantic Cursor question and plan cases above exercise
Paperclip tools, not the native `cursor/ask_question` or `cursor/create_plan` RPCs.
The failed Pi file case exposed two wrapper losses. Profile version 3 at
`06cf356a8bc94f709fcd15606fe05e17933fe3b2` preserves bounded, redacted MCP validation
errors and bounded Bash arguments/output; oversized values have an explicit
omission marker. Version 1 and 2 warm snapshots are rejected. Installed-wrapper
regressions pass. A fresh v3 pack then passed the paid file case: the model received
the actual missing-deliverable receipt error, registered its deliverable and
completed. The original v2 failure remains retained.
Canonical command exit codes and typed generic diff/media projection remain partial.

The Pi denial/file batch cost $0.010995043 by exclusive-key delta. Delayed billing
prevents exact per-call attribution, so the aggregate remains separate from Pi's
catalog estimates and its missing terminal receipt on the file case.

The Cursor file case proves the workspace artifact surface, not complete native
file/diff projection. The Copilot result incorrectly projected missing native cost
as USD zero and attributed its biller to OpenAI. The original result is retained;
the shared fix identifies GitHub, Cursor and OpenRouter correctly and keeps absent
candidate USD receipts unpriced. The separate Copilot file case verifies that fix.
The question case exposed a second ledger edge: zero normalized token counters
were treated as a reported cost despite no cost field. Ledger classification now
requires an explicit finite nonnegative cost; an explicit zero remains reported.
Protocol evals now fail their cost gate when spend is unknown, preserving completed
behavior and semantic evidence in a separate accounting-failure result. The
maintained campaign stops subsequent cells on unknown accounting and never turns
an unavailable receipt into a zero-dollar measurement.

Initial Product attempts exposed local PostgreSQL postinstall hydration and a
server candidate-admission gap before any model prompt. Both failed attempts are
retained. The package's own hydration repairs local installation; exact host
qualification now applies consistently at agent creation, runtime selection,
native input and process construction. Agent configuration cannot grant itself
qualification authority. The obsolete unconditional Pi executor rejection is
replaced by the same closed host authorization. Candidate active turns are bounded
to 120 seconds and automatic infrastructure retries remain disabled.

Pi's next local startup attempt timed out before any prompt, with zero exclusive
key usage delta. A credential-free reproduction isolated a 37.423-second immutable
copy of its 13,827-file, 234,019,683-byte distribution, after 5.168 seconds of
verification, against the 30-second session-open deadline. Bounded parallel copying
reduced that same copy to 5.851 seconds without changing a timeout. Ten tests cover
the eight-file / 32 MiB batch bounds, unchanged per-file integrity checks, stable
digest order, mutation rejection, and draining pending copies before cleanup.
The later `hello06` paid Product case above proves successful inference and
settlement after this startup fix. Its final screenshot shows one readable answer,
a visible Done status and a usable composer, with no duplicate response or error.

The maintained Product E2E `extended-harnesses` suite covers local and Daytona
completion, question/answer, semantic plan approval, pending-input restart and
file edit/validation. It has no automatic retries and does not enable candidates
outside exact operator-authorized provider/model pairs. The private Runner Eval
campaign is complementary: seven semantic protocol cases per provider. Neither
suite's membership is a qualification claim.

Before each paid batch, record source SHA, executable and closure/profile digests,
exact model, OS/architecture or Daytona image, selected cases, prior spend,
maximum batch spend and authoritative billing coverage. Stop before the shared
ceiling. Missing spend coverage blocks a run rather than treating unknown cost as
zero. Retain screenshots and wire evidence without credentials. Never convert a
provider to supported solely because a test suite or packaging check passed.

Verification commands and final results are recorded with the prerequisite and
provider PRs. The full handoff requires runner checks, token gates, recursive
typecheck, `pnpm test:run`, and `pnpm build`. Until that evidence is recorded, this
report is an implementation report rather than a PR-ready certification.

At foundation `5aeebb20c`, recursive typecheck, build, token gates, full Rust runner
checks, conformance/replay parity and API-authority checks passed. Approval
verification includes 18 real database integration tests, 15 projector cases,
87 transcript/UI cases, 82 route/websocket cases and eight provider receipt cases.
The local full root test attempt initially failed because embedded Postgres's
install-time library links were missing. Its official package postinstall restored
them; all 38 affected suites (743 tests) then passed. The workspace streaming stress test initially exceeded macOS path limits
(`ENAMETOOLONG`); the later portable fixture correction is recorded below. The full runner TypeScript repeat passed 2,164 tests in 156 files, with ten
skipped tests. The full UI and CLI suites passed 6,772 and 502 tests. Remaining
source workspace checks passed 2,882 tests; two macOS path-alias fixture failures
were corrected with an explicit injection assertion (all 89 sandbox tests pass),
and a database timeout passed in an isolated repeat. Failed attempts and the
latest CI state remain recorded in the PR. The decision-media review fix passes
87 focused tests, UI typecheck, token gates and the UI build.

At execution source `f063fbf2b`, recursive typecheck, full build, token gates,
13 accounting tests, 10 immutable-distribution tests and seven image-contract tests
pass. Both full UI/CLI shard partitions pass (6,848 UI and 502 CLI tests).
The remaining local test partitions run sequentially after paid Product cells to
avoid the machine's observed PostgreSQL semaphore exhaustion. Earlier failures,
including the unchanged macOS path-length stress case, remain retained. Foundation
CI at this source passed typecheck, build, Rust, both runner test lanes, all twelve
general server shards and all eight browser shards. Six other jobs received a
coordinated runner-shutdown signal; their cancellation is not a passing result.
Greptile reviewed this source at 5/5. Later documentation/build-pin updates still
require their own final check status.

Initial macOS ARM64 candidate packs were independently built and launched through
the generic installation registry: Cursor source `1055c13f8`, Copilot `5d8829add`,
Pi `f58cfa1cb`. Review fixes that change execution bytes require fresh packs and
launch proofs; the latest source SHA, manifest/profile/closure digests and
sanitized wire evidence are retained in each provider PR. Earlier proofs retain
their original source identity. These probes send no model prompt.

Final native Linux packaging probes also run with no network, no credentials and
no model prompt. Cursor source `25fb1b5b317e52a8ad50208d7681a1ee34bd939c` initialized
from image `sha256:5fa7951d1d6dd99305555fe00a5baf2bf5b834d16f021053737301975b93986f`;
its native EOF does not settle within five seconds, so explicit process-group
cleanup is required and verified. Copilot source
`8aa867b64d5fc2fd62cff110bd000addf5dc54de` initialized as version 1.0.88 from image
`sha256:5457769683fd310223d3b0d4f1ed9a6cf341bdb16514746b3aaeabca2e888fee` and exited
zero on EOF. Its metadata-only fixture received zero requests. The provider PRs
retain complete pack/executable digests and sanitized initialization responses.
Pi v3 source `06cf356a8bc94f709fcd15606fe05e17933fe3b2` also initializes and
exits zero from image `sha256:c5fa7976bba92a186a2f70dc8b8ddc58ab86606b80a819c89bf550d2d057c832`,
with profile digest `sha256:72cb225288376f733b9ed3afa5e13565eb4152f0de509bc1181382fa44bee472`.
The earlier Pi v2 proof remains historical.
These are packaging proofs, not paid Daytona or model-availability evidence.

At `e8dee462e2fd09cf858be0a02368805346ec4f3b`, versioned profile contract tests
pass 36 cases and full runner TypeScript checking passes. Nine additional source
workspace suites pass 2,757 tests with 19 skips. An isolated repeat of the unchanged
HTTP redaction suite passes all 59 tests after its earlier concurrent-run timeout.
The feedback-route mock fix retains both company-boundary assertions and passes
two independent fresh-environment repeats (4/4 each). Current source and any
remaining partition failures are recorded in the final prerequisite PR evidence.

The portable real-Git stress fixture passes on macOS in 234.43 seconds, retaining
40,000 files, four independently checked 34,988,890-byte filename lanes, real
staging/deletion and cleanup. Its timeout is 300 seconds on macOS and remains
180 seconds elsewhere. Both earlier failures are retained. All seven remaining
serialized root partitions pass; database-project and previously skipped-file
remediation later passed all ten partitions, including 1,042 chat integration tests.

The combined provider stack passes 616 ACP/profile/backend tests with eight
skips, 34 packaging and actual-wrapper tests, and a TypeScript build. The
Copilot registry regression now verifies dispatch to separate native factories;
the pack test no longer assumes another implemented provider is absent.
The complete database project passes 161 tests in 44 files after serialization;
all ten remediation partitions completed without failure, including the full
1,042-test chat integration lane.

The first Pi plan attempt exposed a shared Rust display-mapping gap: prefixed MCP
tool names were retained as builtin names, preventing the saved Plan from anchoring
to its write event. All four retained browser snapshots showed the fallback Plan
card inside a settled turn, so the existing Product matcher remains unchanged.
Foundation `5aa02662b34fc70f5fe9ffd5ac8f7ae81b5fe3bd` parses both ACP MCP name forms,
preserves bounded/redacted namespace and name, and leaves semantic authorization,
operation and read-only classification unchanged. The original Rust regression
fails before the fix; 55 Rust, 28 TypeScript provider and 158 UI tests pass afterward.
The UI regression distinguishes the proper write-boundary card from the original
fallback. A rebuilt daemon is required for the retained paid retry.

The rebuilt daemon passed the Plan placement and revision-acceptance boundary in
the second paid attempt. Its continuation exposed a separate Pi identity defect:
the owned extension reused native `call_0` as the MCP request ID for different
executions. A rejected finish was followed by a corrected finish and context read,
both correctly rejected by shared duplicate-call protection. Further paid cases
stopped. Pi v4 at `f556110d588a9de9fefe676a9a62bf09e98afb85` binds live identities
to a private launch namespace and a lifetime model-iteration ordinal. Exact
request retries retain their identity; conflicting or duplicate native invocations
within one iteration fail closed. History uses a separate display-only identity.
Bridge idempotence and durable call tombstones stay intact. Raw native IDs remain
private-wire provenance, with the UI omission recorded above.

The corrective-call regression failed before the fix and passes against the real
authenticated loopback tool bridge afterward. The pinned native SDK test covers
six iterations across two warm prompts and four executions that reuse `call_0`;
its native turn index resets, while the owned ordinal remains monotonic. This
check uses an in-memory model stream and no inference. Independent review and
profile-digest verification pass. At that v4 checkpoint, the profile digest was:
`sha256:2324d9b47650c12b16f8e2c44dc33637d52f1b22ba8e914623eac4049e7e1991`.
Earlier v1-v3 snapshots could not establish that runtime identity. The extended
Runner Eval configuration then pinned v4 and rejected those historical identities;
all 132 eval tests and seven-cell Pi campaign validation passed without provider
calls at that checkpoint. The later v5 identity is recorded below.

Recursive typecheck and the full build both pass at shared repair source
`5aa02662b34fc70f5fe9ffd5ac8f7ae81b5fe3bd` and again at version-admission source
`1545c7692`. The latter adds closed profile-version-4 admission, with 22 contract
tests and full runner TypeScript checks passing. Exact profile digest matching
remains mandatory. Recursive typecheck and the full repository build also pass
on the frozen combined provider source `f556110d588a9de9fefe676a9a62bf09e98afb85`,
including Pi v4. The combined macOS ARM64 provider pack
at `7ab463697037c9456a4ad2b83ea0e9c28b353f8a` independently verifies all three
complete candidate trees (446 Cursor files, one Copilot executable and 13,827 Pi
files), manifest digest
`sha256:0800f10114e3d8e2e981ea27f0ab47f1da9349dbcc22bf55a76ebbc4af00601d`.
All three initialize through the verified registry without credentials or model
prompts. The combined Linux image at source
`e35b11db21b8da8527fa0b6c6f5fe186bdced111` also passes all three initialization
probes under network-none and a read-only root. Image digest:
`sha256:17c228d3b9744d6bf375ead57918c755d0cc44fc3db44d238cc898317cea25ce`;
pack digest: `sha256:4e0ddb39a34e7f55d7520a8a2d9074009589f3f95f4c10bb837e54ec58d70ba1`.
These combined proofs contain Pi v3 and retain that historical identity when the
invocation-identity repair produces a new profile. They are not paid Daytona proof.
All candidates remain pending; verification and packaging do not grant support.

The fresh v4 macOS ARM64 pack at the frozen combined source has digest
`sha256:4df7e9fa164929c7ae7d8e8711f0bf7d587d9fa6a246d0a8340f318f57168855`.
All 13,827 Pi runtime files independently match the pinned closure. Native
initialization under denied networking exits cleanly; the complete Runner path
returns the expected typed missing-key rejection without inference. The rebuilt
daemon has SHA-256 `373848d2d7287b2c47b2cee422cb7bd25073a594a620a9ad574f2d3d51cd1670`.
The next canonical paid plan attempt stopped in PostgreSQL initialization before
provider startup. Its unchanged billing and exact disposable initdb failure are
retained. The diagnostic created no server, removed its temporary directory, and
left IPC totals unchanged. Unrelated database processes and IPC objects were not
modified. Canonical Product E2E does not currently admit an external database
substitute; introducing one requires its own ownership, isolation and cleanup
proof rather than bypassing the existing guard.

The v4 native probe above does not need a database and passed independently of
the host PostgreSQL blocker. A read-only IPC attribution audit found no semaphore
set with sufficient task provenance for safe cleanup; no unrelated set was
removed. The paid Product and Daytona qualification gaps remain open.

Dependency review subsequently identified Pi's pinned `undici@8.9.0` in
[GHSA-3wwx-pv8p-q78v](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3wwx-pv8p-q78v),
indexed in GitHub's advisory database on September 28. Pi's owned Node 24.19.0
also embeds affected Undici 7.29.0. The repair requires both the exact npm override
and the provider-local patched Node distribution; it cannot be represented by a
waived check or a claim that updating npm replaces Node's builtin implementation.
Shared contract source `e6163e16a` admits closed profile version 5, with 23 contract
cases and full runner TypeScript checking passing; unknown versions remain
rejected and exact command digests remain mandatory.

The combined v4 Linux image at frozen source `f556110d588a9de9fefe676a9a62bf09e98afb85`
was built and all three providers passed credential-free initialization under
network-none with a read-only root. Image digest:
`sha256:4c4e2fb7eb8ef3681b14c3e21dd28eace5ef920d6d08d572fb9c9c7e9a5f290a`;
pack digest: `sha256:8f263ed5c309b47cdc74a37d8217bb49e57129fca393498f54f6dd461657a9b9`.
The daemon SHA-256 is `5914ed1ad0235aaee9af8731af2cbf28d7b16b0fda231a13963f1d86c3220daa`.
Cursor still needs explicit cleanup after EOF; Copilot and Pi exit zero. No model
prompt or credential was supplied. This remains a historical packaging proof
when the dependency repair changes Pi's profile and executable closure.

Recursive `pnpm -r typecheck` and `pnpm build` also pass at shared version-5
admission source `e6163e16a`; no database or model request is used by those checks.

Pi v5 repair source `aec26ad83f1d082f0d0a5eaffbd615a9e2e26155` pins private
Node 24.21.0 (bundled Undici 7.29.1) and nested npm Undici 8.10.2. Because npm
retains the vulnerable shrinkwrapped package despite overrides, materialization
verifies the exact published old tuple, replaces only that package from a bounded,
integrity-checked fixed archive, and then verifies the complete trusted closure.
The upstream Pi package and shrinkwrap bytes remain unchanged; the exception is
explicit and closed. Profile digest:
`sha256:020d96ccbd3c45c3f62680814776394ed5a56d9572a1a4dccda56a74d16c7803`.
Old versions 1–4 are rejected. Forty-three focused TypeScript tests, 19 package
checks, eight materializer checks and 13 Rust tests pass. Independent review verified all 13,827 installed
files, both patched dependency copies, eight materializer and twelve profile/
recovery cases. Recursive typecheck and the full build pass at the same source.

Shared Docker pin source `3a5637732` uses the official Linux x64
`node:24.21.0-bookworm@sha256:5a750d3be5e5c80275f8c9a5367c3aed99c2875656590c8d0701c7ee687f5f0a`
for the outer provider pack. A network-disabled launch independently reports
Node 24.21.0 and Undici 7.29.1, matching the
[official Node release](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v24.21.0). All seven
image-contract tests pass. The first local test invocation failed because the
root has no `tsx` executable; the retained retry used the maintained Vitest
configuration. No provider call was made by either command. Pack authority
includes the outer Node bytes and is bound into the persisted launch profile;
changes invalidate incompatible warm recovery independently of Pi's profile bump.

The fresh v5 macOS ARM64 combined pack has manifest digest
`sha256:cf7d0998bbc2bed7b893c726c2b6455ba8a683d9cff7d92afedbff2d5900d500`
and source `aec26ad83f1d082f0d0a5eaffbd615a9e2e26155`. Independent initialization
through the verified registry passes for Cursor, Copilot and Pi with no provider
credentials or prompts. The outer interpreter reports Node 24.21.0 and Undici
7.29.1. Cursor still requires explicit process-group cleanup after EOF; Copilot
and Pi exit zero. All owned processes and private supervisor directories are
cleaned. Cursor/Copilot profile and closure identities match their prior pack.
The proof index has SHA-256
`a07394e3215eb0a153c4a9443762a5d84ddfe0e70b92e1d47ae8d574239e104c`.

The private Runner Eval campaign now pins v5 at eval source
`18f06b9391838d637c1588f372c7f1397ec6f9a7`. All 133 Python tests and the seven-cell
Pi validation pass without provider calls. Explicit tests reject each historical
v1–v4 version, digest and paired identity. Cases, model, scoring, budgets and
deadlines remain unchanged.

Current Linux image identities and exact-head CI/review status are recorded in
the [Pi PR verification](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/pull/14436) and
[foundation PR verification](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/pull/14430).
Their immutable source and dependency identities remain distinct from the
historical packaging proofs above. Image initialization does not certify paid
Daytona execution. Those were historical blockers at that checkpoint. The current production
checkpoint above records the present blockers; Daytona API authentication and
analytics access have since been verified.
